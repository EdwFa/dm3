However, the emergence of variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may threaten the global impact of mass vaccination campaigns. AIMS: The objective of this study was to provide an up-to-date comparative analysis of the characteristics, adverse events, efficacy, effectiveness and impact of the variants of concern for 19 COVID-19 vaccines. SOURCES: References for this review were identified through searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, regulatory drug agencies and pharmaceutical companies' websites up to 22nd September 2021. CONTENT: Overall, all COVID-19 vaccines had a high efficacy against the original strain and the variants of concern, and were well tolerated. BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and Sputnik V after two doses had the highest efficacy (>90%) in preventing symptomatic cases in phase III trials. mRNA vaccines, AZD1222, and CoronaVac were effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe infections against Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta variants. Regarding observational real-life data, full immunization with mRNA vaccines and AZD1222 seems to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection against the original strain and Alpha and Beta variants but with reduced effectiveness against the Delta strain. A decline in infection protection was observed at 6 months for BNT162b2 and AZD1222. Serious adverse event rates were rare for mRNA vaccines-anaphylaxis 2.5-4.7 cases per million doses, myocarditis 3.5 cases per million doses-and were similarly rare for all other vaccines. Prices for the different vaccines varied from $2.15 to $29.75 per dose. IMPLICATIONS: All vaccines appear to be safe and effective tools to prevent severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death against all variants of concern, but the quality of evidence greatly varies depending on the vaccines considered. Questions remain regarding a booster dose and waning immunity, the duration of immunity, and heterologous vaccination. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks, despite rare serious adverse effects.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34715347/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S1198-743X(21)00604-2 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.10.005", "pt": "Journal Article; Review", "pl": "England", "topic": 0, "prop": 0.9270228931951915}, {"uid": 34755408, "aid": "RMV2313 10.1002/rmv.2313", "titl": "Covid-19 vaccines and variants of concern: A review.", "mesh": "Antibodies, Viral;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects/therapeutic use;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus;;; Vaccines, Synthetic", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Hadj Hassine, Ikbel", "jour": "Reviews in medical virology", "affl": "Unite de Recherche UR17ES30 'Genomique, Biotechnologie et Strategies Antivirales', Institut Superieur de Biotechnologie, Universite de Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.", "pdat": "2022 Jul", "tiab": "Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in December 2019, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the number of confirmed infections has risen to more than 242 million worldwide, with nearly 5 million deaths. Currently, nine Covid-19 vaccine candidates based on the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain are at the forefront of vaccine research. All nine had an efficacy over 50% against symptomatic Covid-19 disease: NVX-CoV2373 ( approximately 96%), BNT162b2 ( approximately 95%), mRNA-1273 ( approximately 94%), Sputnik V ( approximately 92%), AZD1222 ( approximately 81%), BBIBP-CorV ( approximately 79%), Covaxin ( approximately 78%), Ad26.CoV.S ( approximately 66%) and CoronaVac ( approximately 51%). However, vaccine efficacy (VE) can be jeopardised by the rapid emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that could escape from neutralising antibodies and/or cell-mediated immunity. Rare adverse events have also been reported soon after administration of viral vector and mRNA vaccines. Although many Covid-19 vaccines have been developed, additional effective vaccines are still needed to meet the global demand. Promising Covid-19 vaccines such as WIBP-CorV, AD5-nCOV, ZyCoV-D, CVnCoV, EpiVacCorona and ZF2001 have advanced to clinical studies.

METHODS: We investigated the duration and effectiveness of immunity in a prospective cohort of asymptomatic health care workers in the United Kingdom who underwent routine polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing. Vaccine effectiveness (</=10 months after the first dose of vaccine) and infection-acquired immunity were assessed by comparing the time to PCR-confirmed infection in vaccinated persons with that in unvaccinated persons, stratified according to previous infection status. We used a Cox regression model with adjustment for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status, vaccine type and dosing interval, demographic characteristics, and workplace exposure to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 35,768 participants, 27% (9488) had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine coverage was high: 95% of the participants had received two doses (78% had received BNT162b2 vaccine [Pfizer-BioNTech] with a long interval between doses, 9% BNT162b2 vaccine with a short interval between doses, and 8% ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine [AstraZeneca]). Between December 7, 2020, and September 21, 2021, a total of 2747 primary infections and 210 reinfections were observed. Among previously uninfected participants who received long-interval BNT162b2 vaccine, adjusted vaccine effectiveness decreased from 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72 to 92) 14 to 73 days after the second dose to 51% (95% CI, 22 to 69) at a median of 201 days (interquartile range, 197 to 205) after the second dose; this effectiveness did not differ significantly between the long-interval and short-interval BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. At 14 to 73 days after the second dose, adjusted vaccine effectiveness among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients was 58% (95% CI, 23 to 77) - considerably lower than that among BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. Infection-acquired immunity waned after 1 year in unvaccinated participants but remained consistently higher than 90% in those who were subsequently vaccinated, even in persons infected more than 18 months previously. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine were associated with high short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection; this protection waned considerably after 6 months. Infection-acquired immunity boosted with vaccination remained high more than 1 year after infection.

This review evaluates how adenovirus (Ad) vector platforms have been leveraged in response to this pandemic.

Although vaccination still lowers the risk of infection, similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who are infected with the delta variant call into question the degree to which vaccination prevents transmission. METHODS: We used contact-testing data from England to perform a retrospective observational cohort study involving adult contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected adult index patients. We used multivariable Poisson regression to investigate associations between transmission and the vaccination status of index patients and contacts and to determine how these associations varied with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and delta variants and time since the second vaccination. RESULTS: Among 146,243 tested contacts of 108,498 index patients, 54,667 (37%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests. In index patients who became infected with the alpha variant, two vaccinations with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (also known as AZD1222), as compared with no vaccination, were independently associated with reduced PCR positivity in contacts (adjusted rate ratio with BNT162b2, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.48; and with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.78). Vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the delta variant were smaller than those with the alpha variant, and reductions in transmission of the delta variant after two BNT162b2 vaccinations were greater (adjusted rate ratio for the comparison with no vaccination, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.65) than after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations (adjusted rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.82). Variation in cycle-threshold (Ct) values (indicative of viral load) in index patients explained 7 to 23% of vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the two variants. The reductions in transmission of the delta variant declined over time after the second vaccination, reaching levels that were similar to those in unvaccinated persons by 12 weeks in index patients who had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and attenuating substantially in those who had received BNT162b2. Protection in contacts also declined in the 3-month period after the second vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was associated with a smaller reduction in transmission of the delta variant than of the alpha variant, and the effects of vaccination decreased over time. PCR Ct values at diagnosis of the index patient only partially explained decreased transmission.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of symptomatic infection with prior vaccination with BNT162b2 to estimate VE among children and adolescents during Omicron variant predominance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A test-negative, case-control analysis was conducted using data from 6897 pharmacy-based, drive-through SARS-CoV-2 testing sites across the US from a single pharmacy chain in the Increasing Community Access to Testing platform. This analysis included 74\u202f208 tests from children 5 to 11 years of age and 47\u202f744 tests from adolescents 12 to 15 years of age with COVID-19-like illness who underwent SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing from December 26, 2021, to February 21, 2022. EXPOSURES: Two BNT162b2 doses 2 weeks or more before SARS-CoV-2 testing vs no vaccination for children; 2 or 3 doses 2 weeks or more before testing vs no vaccination for adolescents (who are recommended to receive a booster dose). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Symptomatic infection. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association of prior vaccination and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was used to estimate VE: VE = (1 - OR) x 100%. RESULTS: A total of 30\u202f999 test-positive cases and 43\u202f209 test-negative controls were included from children 5 to 11 years of age, as well as 22\u202f273 test-positive cases and 25\u202f471 test-negative controls from adolescents 12 to 15 years of age.

A total of 10 studies from four countries were identified and summarized in this review. EXPERT OPINION: VE of the widely available COVID-19 vaccines, including BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen), and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), ranged from 64% to 90% against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73% to 84% against symptomatic illness, 70% to 100% against severe illness, and 63% to 100% against COVID-19-related hospitalization among the fully vaccinated IC populations included in the studies. COVID-19 VE for most outcomes in the IC populations included in these studies were lower than in the general populations.

COVID-19 vaccination strategies have been implemented worldwide, and repeat COVID-19 outbreaks have been seen. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the reduction of perceived anxiety and the association between public anxiety and antibody testing intention during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Chinese adults aged 18 and over were surveyed using an anonymous online questionnaire in April and May 2021. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination characteristics, perceived anxiety due to COVID-19, and attitudes toward future antibody testing after COVID-19 vaccination. Perceived anxiety was assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors influencing future antibody detection. RESULTS: A total of 3,233 people were investigated, 3,209 valid questionnaires were collected, and the response rate was 99.3%. Of the 3,209 respondents, 2,047 were vaccinated, and 1,162 were unvaccinated. There was a significant difference in anxiety levels between vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents (24.9+/-25.4 vs. 50.0+/-33.1, respectively). With the local spread of COVID-19 in mainland China, the public anxiety VAS scores increased by 15.4+/-25.6 (SMD=120%) and 33.8+/-31.7 (SMD=49%) among vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents, respectively. Of the 2,047 respondents who were vaccinated, 1,626 (79.4%) thought they would accept antibody testing. Those who displayed more anxiety about acquiring COVID-19 disease were more likely to accept COVID-19 antibody testing. If the antibody test results showed protective antibodies, 1,190 (58.1%) were more likely to arrange travel plans in China, while 526 (25.7%) thought they would feel safer traveling abroad. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination strategies help reduce public anxiety. However, public anxiety may be elevated as the local transmission of COVID-19 occurs in mainland China, which is usually caused now by imported cases. Those who display more anxiety choose to have antibody testing. Improving the accessibility of COVID-19 antibody tests can help ease public anxiety and enhance the confidence of some people to participate in social activities.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35602124/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fpubh.2022.819062", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35202522, "aid": "21-1561 10.3201/eid2803.211561", "titl": "COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage, Behaviors, and Intentions among Adults with Previous Diagnosis, United States.", "mesh": "Adult;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; Intention;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; United States/epidemiology;;; Vaccination;;; *Vaccination Coverage", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Nguyen, Kimberly H; Huang, Jing; Mansfield, Kathrine; Corlin, Laura; Allen, Jennifer D", "jour": "Emerging infectious diseases", "affl": "\u0431\u0435\u0437 AD", "pdat": "2022 Mar", "tiab": "To determine the extent of gaps in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine coverage among those in the United States with and without previous COVID-19 diagnoses, we used data from a large, nationally representative survey conducted during July 21-August 2, 2021.

Since then, efforts were initiated to develop safe and effective vaccines. Till date, 11 vaccines have been included in the WHO's emergency use list. The emergence and spread of variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 has altered the disease transmission dynamics, thus creating a need for continuously monitoring the real-world effectiveness of various vaccines and assessing their overall impact on disease control. To achieve this goal, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) along with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, took the lead to develop the India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker by synergizing three different public health databases: National COVID-19 testing database, CoWIN vaccination database and the COVID-19 India portal. A Vaccine Data Analytics Committee (VDAC) was constituted to advise on various modalities of the proposed tracker. The VDAC reviewed the data related to COVID-19 testing, vaccination and patient outcomes available in the three databases and selected relevant data points for inclusion in the tracker, following which databases were integrated, using common identifiers, wherever feasible. Multiple data filters were applied to retrieve information of all individuals >/=18 yr who died after the acquisition of COVID-19 infection with or without vaccination, irrespective of the time between vaccination and test positivity. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the reduction of mortality and hospitalizations was initially assessed. As compared to the hospitalization data, mortality reporting was found to be much better in terms of correctness and completeness. Therefore, hospitalization data were not considered for analysis and presentation in the vaccine tracker. The vaccine tracker thus depicts VE against mortality, calculated by a cohort approach using person-time analysis. Incidence of COVID-19 deaths among one- and two-dose vaccine recipients was compared with that among unvaccinated groups, to estimate the rate ratios (RRs). VE was estimated as 96.6 and 97.5 per cent, with one and two doses of the vaccines, respectively, during the period of reporting. The India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker was officially launched on September 9, 2021. The high VE against mortality, as demonstrated by the tracker, has helped aid in allaying vaccine hesitancy, augmenting and maintaining the momentum of India's COVID-19 vaccination drive.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35859397/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/351473 https://sci-hub.do/IJMR-155-513 https://sci-hub.do/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_3500_21", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "India", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36995773, "aid": "2191577 10.1080/21645515.2023.2191577", "titl": "Tracking the COVID-19 vaccines: The global landscape.", "mesh": "United States;;; Humans;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Ad26COVS1;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Yadav, Tushar; Kumar, Swatantra; Mishra, Gourav; Saxena, Shailendra K", "jour": "Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics", "affl": "Department of Zoology, Jawaharlal Nehru Smriti Government Post Graduate College, Shujalpur, India.;;; Centre for Advanced Research (CFAR), Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, India.;;; World Society for Virology, Northampton, MA, USA.;;; The Indian Virological Society, New Delhi, India.;;; Department of Biotechnology, Meerut Institute of Engineering and Technology, Meerut, India.;;; Centre for Advanced Research (CFAR), Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, India.;;; World Society for Virology, Northampton, MA, USA.;;; The Indian Virological Society, New Delhi, India.", "pdat": "2023 Dec 31", "tiab": "COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; VLPs: Virus like particles; WHO: World Health Organization; E: Envelope; M: Membrane; S: Spike; N: Nucleocapsid; PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; FDA: Food and Drug Administration; LNP: lipid-nanoparticle; AZD1222: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; BNT162b2: Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine; mRNA-1273: Moderna vaccine; Ad26.COV2.S: Johnson and Johnson - Janssen's vaccine; Gam-COVID-Vac: Sputnik Vaccine; NVX-CoV2373: Novavax vaccine with Matrix-M adjuvant.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36995773/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/2191577 https://sci-hub.do/10.1080/21645515.2023.2191577", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review", "pl": "United States", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 34346306, "aid": "S1935789321002585 10.1017/dmp.2021.258", "titl": "COVID-19 in South Korea: Proper Timing for Easing Mask Mandates After COVID-19 Vaccination.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Ad26COVS1;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Republic of Korea;;; Vaccination", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Kang, Yun-Jung", "jour": "Disaster medicine and public health preparedness", "affl": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Ansan University, Ansan, Republic of Korea.", "pdat": "2022 Oct", "tiab": "OBJECTIVE: As of July 25, 2021, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 1,422 new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, 188,848 total cases, and 2,073 total deaths (1.10% fatality rates).

We performed an inverse-variance meta-analysis of population-level effectiveness from public health reports in > 40 million individuals. RESULTS: A single dose of either mRNA vaccine yielded comparable antibody and neutralization titers to convalescent individuals. Ad26.COV2.S yielded lower antibody concentrations and frequently undetectable neutralization titers. Bulk and cytotoxic T-cell responses were higher in mRNA1273 and BNT162b2 than Ad26.COV2.S recipients. Regardless of vaccine, <50% of vaccinees demonstrated CD8+ T-cell responses. Antibody concentrations and neutralization titers increased comparably after the first dose of either vaccine, and further in recipients of a second dose. Prior infection was associated with high antibody concentrations and neutralization even after a single dose and regardless of vaccine. Neutralization of Beta, Gamma, and Delta strains were poorer regardless of vaccine. In meta-analysis, relative to mRNA1273 the effectiveness of BNT162b2 was lower against infection and hospitalization, and Ad26COV2.S was lower against infection, hospitalization, and death.

METHODS: The National Surveillance System with the National Immunization Registry were linked to form a large-linked database for assessment. Age-adjusted incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe disease, and death by vaccination status are calculated. Weekly vaccine effectiveness was calculated based on incidence rate ratio (IRR) between fully-vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, as: IRR = incidence rate of vaccinated / incidence rate of unvaccinated. We estimate the cumulative SARS-CoV-2 outcome overtime comparing the observed case with predicted cases without vaccination. RESULTS: Age-adjusted incidence in unvaccinated persons (5.69 per 100,000 person-day) was 2.7 times the rate in fully vaccinated (2.13 per 100,000 person-day) persons, resulting effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of 63%. Vaccine effectiveness against severe disease and death were 93% and 95%, respectively. Between March and October 2021, estimated Covid-19 related outcomes averted by vaccinations were: 46,508 infections, 3,424 severe diseases, and 718 deaths.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and JNJ-78436735 vaccines among US military personnel before and during the predominance of the Delta variant in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study was conducted among all unvaccinated and fully vaccinated US military personnel who had a documented SARS-CoV-2 test performed in the US between January 1 and September 24, 2021. Individuals were identified using Department of Defense (DOD) electronic medical, laboratory, and surveillance databases. The pre-Delta period was defined as January 1 to May 31, 2021, and the Delta period as June 19 to September 24, 2021. Case individuals were defined by a positive polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 test result or a positive antigen test result with symptoms. Control individuals had at least 1 negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 vaccination with the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, or JNJ-78436735 vaccine, assessed from DOD electronic vaccination records. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness overall, by vaccine type, and by outcome stratified by the pre-Delta and Delta periods in the US. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 100 x (1 - odds ratio) in a logistic regression model with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: The cohort included 441\u202f379 individuals, with 290\u202f256 in the pre-Delta period (236\u202f555 [81%] male; median age, 25 years [range, 17-68 years]) and 151\u202f123 in the Delta period (120\u202f536 [80%] male; median age, 26 years [range, 17-70 years]). Adjusted vaccine effectiveness of all vaccines was significantly higher during the pre-Delta period (89.2%; 95% CI, 88.1%-90.1%) compared with the Delta period (70.2%; 95% CI, 69.3%-71.1%) for all outcomes, an overall decrease of 19%. mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness was highest in the pre-Delta (93.5%; 95% CI, 91.9%-94.7%) and Delta (79.4%; 95% CI, 78.3%-80.4%) periods for all outcomes, whereas the JNJ-78436735 vaccine had the lowest effectiveness during the pre-Delta (81.8%; 95% CI, 74.2%- 87.1%) and Delta (38.3%; 95% CI, 34.5%-41.9%) periods. Effectiveness for all vaccines during both periods was higher for symptomatic infection and hospitalization among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case-control study, among US military personnel, COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness was significantly lower during the period when the Delta variant predominated compared with the period before Delta variant predominance; this was especially true for the JNJ-78436735 vaccine. These findings were confounded by time since vaccination; this and the change in effectiveness support the need for booster doses and continued evaluation of vaccine effectiveness as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35442453/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/2791306 https://sci-hub.do/zoi220250 https://sci-hub.do/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.8071", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United States", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35896283, "aid": "fmch-2022-001692 10.1136/fmch-2022-001692", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2 infections and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines among healthcare workers in the New York Metropolitan area, USA.", "mesh": "Adolescent;;; Adult;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;;; Cross-Sectional Studies;;; Health Personnel;;; Humans;;; New York/epidemiology;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Agaku, Israel T; Dimaggio, Alisa; Fishelov, Avigal; Brathwaite, Alianne; Ahmed, Saief; Malinowski, Michelle; Long, Theodore", "jour": "Family medicine and community health", "affl": "Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA iagaku@post.harvard.edu.;;; COVID-19 Test and Trace Corps, New York, New York, USA.;;; COVID-19 Test and Trace Corps, New York, New York, USA.;;; COVID-19 Test and Trace Corps, New York, New York, USA.;;; COVID-19 Test and Trace Corps, New York, New York, USA.;;; COVID-19 Test and Trace Corps, New York, New York, USA.;;; COVID-19 Test and Trace Corps, New York, New York, USA.;;; COVID-19 Test and Trace Corps, New York, New York, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Jul", "tiab": "OBJECTIVE: Because of their increased interaction with patients, healthcare workers (HCWs) face greater vulnerability to COVID-19 exposure than the general population.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) conducted during July to October 2021. SETTING: HPS is designed to yield representative estimates of the US population aged >/=18 years nationally, by state and across selected metropolitan areas. PARTICIPANTS: Our primary analytical sample was adult HCWs in the New York Metropolitan area (n=555), with HCWs defined as individuals who reported working in a 'Hospital'; 'Nursing and residential healthcare facility'; 'Pharmacy' or 'Ambulatory healthcare setting'. In the entire national sample, n=25 909 HCWs completed the survey. Descriptive analyses were performed with HCW data from the New York Metropolitan area, the original epicentre of the pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on pooled national HCW data to explore how HCW COVID-19-related experiences, perceptions and behaviours varied as a function of broader geographic, clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of HCWs surveyed in the New York Metropolitan area, 92.3% reported being fully vaccinated, and 20.9% had ever been diagnosed of COVID-19. Of the subset of HCWs in the New York Metropolitan area not yet fully vaccinated, 41.8% were vaccine unsure, 4.5% planned to get vaccinated for the first time soon, 1.6% had got their first dose but were not planning to receive the remaining dose, while 52.1% had got their first dose and planned to receive the remaining dose. Within pooled multivariable analysis of the national HCW sample, personnel in nursing/residential facilities were less likely to be fully vaccinated (adjusted OR, AOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98) and more likely to report ever COVID-19 diagnosis (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.62), than those working in hospitals. Of HCWs not yet vaccinated nationally, vaccine-unsure individuals were more likely to be White and work in pharmacies, whereas vaccine-accepting individuals were more likely to be employed by non-profit organisations and work in ambulatory care facilities. Virtually no HCW was outrightly vaccine-averse, only unsure. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in vaccination coverage existed by individual HCW characteristics and healthcare operational settings.

The aim of this study was to verify the safety of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in hemodialysis patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of in-center hemodialysis patients who underwent mRNA-1273 vaccine from March 1st to April 30th, 2021. All AEs occurring after the first and the second doses were collected and classified as local or systemic. Results: Overall, 126 patients on chronic maintenance dialysis without a prior COVID-19 diagnosis were vaccinated with two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine. Mean age was 68 (IQR, 54,7-76) years and 53.6% of patients were aged >/=65 years. During the observational period of 68 (IQR, 66-70) days, AEs occurred in 57.9% and 61.9% of patients after the first dose and second dose, respectively. The most common AEs were: injection-site pain (61.9%), erythema (4.8%), itching (4.8%), swelling (16.7%), axillary swelling/tenderness (2.4%), fever (17.5%) headache (7.9%), fatigue (23.8%), myalgia (17.5%), arthralgia (12.7%), dyspnoea (2.4%), nausea/vomiting (7.1%), diarrhoea (5.6%), shivers (4%) and vertigo (1.6%). The rates of local AEs were similar after the first and second doses (P=0.8), whereas systemic AEs occurred more frequently after the second dose (P=0.001). Fever (P=0.03), fatigue (P=0.02) and nausea/vomiting (P=0.03) were significantly more frequent after the second dose of the vaccine. There were no age-related differences in the rate of AEs. Overall, vaccine-related AEs in hemodialysis patients seem to be lower than in the general population.

Sera from vaccinated obese individuals (n = 73) and normal BMI controls (n = 46) were subjected to S-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and serum-neutralization test (SNT) to determine the prevalence and titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Nucleocapsid-ELISA was also utilized to distinguish between immunity acquired via vaccination only versus vaccination plus recovery from infection. Data were linked to participant demographics including age, gender, past COVID-19 diagnosis, and COVID-19 vaccination profile. S-based ELISA demonstrated high seroprevalence rates (>97%) in the study and control groups whether samples with evidence of past infection were included or excluded. Interestingly, however, SNT demonstrated a slightly significant reduction in both the rate and titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies among vaccinated obese individuals (60/73; 82.19%) compared to controls (45/46; 97.83%). The observed reduction in COVID-19 vaccine-induced neutralizing humoral immunity among obese individuals occurs independently of gender, recovery from past infection, and period from last vaccination. Our data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in inducing protective humoral immunity. This effectiveness, however, is potentially reduced among obese individuals which highlight the importance of booster doses to improve their neutralizing immunity. Further investigations on larger sample size remain necessary to comprehensively conclude about the effect of obesity on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness on humoral immunity induction.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36068377/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/JMV28130 https://sci-hub.do/10.1002/jmv.28130", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 34973442, "aid": "S1878-8750(21)01921-5 10.1016/j.wneu.2021.12.076", "titl": "A Year of Pandemic-Comparison of Depression Among Neurosurgeons After the Advent of the COVID-19 Vaccine.", "mesh": "Adult;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Depression/epidemiology;;; Humans;;; Neurosurgeons;;; Pandemics;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Surveys and Questionnaires;;; *Vaccines", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Sharif, Salman; Amin, Faridah; Hafiz, Mehak; Costa, Francesco; Dahlan, Rully Hanafi; Vaishya, Sandeep; Peev, Nikolay; Benzel, Edward", "jour": "World neurosurgery", "affl": "Department of Neurosurgery, Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.

METHODS: An online survey was completed by neurosurgeons worldwide over 4 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by the 20-item self-reporting questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 534 responses were received and analyzed. Almost half of the respondents were from Asia (50.9%), followed by Europe (38.8%). The majority of the respondents were <40 years old (88%), and almost two thirds were trainees (62.2%). Half of the respondents worked in departments with <40 beds (50.7%), and the majority were practicing in the private sector (72.5%). Most of the respondents (85.8%) had COVID-19-positive colleagues in their department, and 64% had exposure to a COVID-19-positive colleague, family member, and/or patient. More than half of the respondents were exposed to infected patients and/or colleagues, and almost half (43.1%) underwent COVID-19 testing when exposed. Nearly half of the respondents underwent COVID-19 testing more than twice (52.4%). Of respondents, 83% had received at least the first dose of the vaccine. The odds of depression among vaccinated respondents were found to be significantly less than among unvaccinated respondents in the univariable model. CONCLUSIONS: Among health care workers, neurosurgeons are one of the groups indirectly affected by the pandemic.

We investigated the immunogenicity and adverse events of the third dose of mRNA vaccines in healthy adults. METHODS: Volunteers vaccinated with two doses of the adenoviral vaccine (ChAdOx1) 12 weeks before were administered with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. These were divided into three groups, full-dose mRNA-1273 (group 1); half-dose mRNA-1273 (group 2); and full-dose BNT-162b2 (group 3). Primary outcomes included serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers and neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.617.2 (delta), and B.1.1.529 (omicron) variants. Secondary outcomes included the evaluation of humoral and cellular immunity and vaccine-associated adverse events after the boost. RESULTS: Totally 300 participants were recruited, and 298 participants were enrolled. For all three groups, an increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG geometric mean titers (30.12- to 71.80-fold) and neutralizing antibody titers against the alpha variant (69.80- to 173.23-folds), delta variant (132.69- to 324.63-folds), and omicron variant (135.36- to 222.37-folds) were observed on day 28. All groups showed robust T- and B-cell responses after boosting. Adverse events were overall mild and transient but with higher prevalence and severity in group 1 participants than in other groups. CONCLUSION: Third dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccines markedly enhanced cellular and humoral responses and were safe.

Plasmas were collected after two doses of matching AZD1222 (AZx2), two doses of matching mRNA-1273 (Mx2), or mixing AZD1222 and mRNA-1273 (AZ+M). The results showed a significant decrease of surrogate neutralizing antibodies against the receptor-binding domain in all VOCs in AZx2 and Mx2 but not AZ+M. A similar but minor reduction pattern of surrogate neutralizing antibodies against the extracellular domain was observed. While Mx2 exhibited a higher surrogate neutralizing level against all VOCs compared with AZx2, AZ+M showed an even higher surrogate neutralizing level in gamma and omicron compared with Mx2. It is worth noting that the binding antibody displayed a low correlation to the surrogate neutralizing antibody (R-square 0.130-0.382).

In this longitudinal prospective study (January 21-October 30, 2021), 90 naive and 15 convalescent individuals were enrolled at the initiation of vaccination. Samples from 27 unvaccinated individuals with previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were collected at a single time point. Longitudinal serology profile (antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] S and N proteins) and live-virus-based neutralization capacities were assessed while controlling for age. Sex, age, history of reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine, and viral neutralization capacities were identified as significant risk factors for breakthrough COVID-19. At 8 months postvaccination, male sex, individuals \u2a7e65 years of age, and individuals who experienced noticeable side effects with the COVID-19 vaccine were at 5.47 (p-value = 0.0102), 4.33 (p-value = 0.0236), and 4.95 (p-value = 0.0159) fold greater risk of BC19 as compared to their peers, respectively. Importantly, every five-fold increase in viral neutralization capacities (by live-virus-based assays) was significantly associated with ~4-fold reduction in the risk occurrence of breakthrough COVID-19 (p-value = 0.045). Vaccine boosting remarkably increased these viral neutralization capacities by 16.22-fold (p- value = 0.0005), supporting the importance of the BNT162b2 booster in efforts to control the incursion of future variants into the population at large. Strikingly, BC19 cases exhibited a delayed/absent antibody response to the N protein, suggesting limited exposure to the virus.

Booster vaccination of individuals can improve waning immunity and reduce the impact of community epidemics. METHODS: Using an epidemiological model that incorporates population-level severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and waning of vaccine-derived immunity, we identify the hypothetical potential of mass vaccination with fractionated vaccine doses specific to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222 [Covishield]; AstraZeneca) as an optimal and cost-effective strategy in India's Omicron outbreak. FINDINGS: We find that the optimal strategy is 1/8 fractional dosing under mild (Re  approximately  1.2) and rapid (Re  approximately  5) transmission scenarios, leading to an estimated $6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -13, 26) billion and $2 (95% CI: -26, 30) billion in health-related net monetary benefit over 200 days, respectively. Rapid and broad use of fractional dosing for boosters, together with delivery costs divided by fractionation, could substantially gain more net monetary benefit by $11 (95% CI: -10, 33) and $2 (95% CI: -23, 28) billion, respectively, under the mild and rapid transmission scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Mass vaccination with fractional doses of COVID-19 vaccines to boost immunity in a vaccinated population could be a cost-effective strategy for mitigating the public health costs of resurgences caused by vaccine-evasive variants, and fractional dosing deserves further clinical and regulatory evaluation.

Little is known about the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents in the general population, as opposed to a clinical trial population. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a matched case-control study among adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who had results from a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Immunization histories, relevant clinical data, and RT-PCR test results were obtained from the Yale New Haven Health System's medical records between June 1, 2021, and August 15, 2021, when the Delta variant caused 92% of infections in Connecticut. Case participants were defined as adolescents who had a positive test result and an associated medical encounter. Control participants were defined as those who had a negative test result and were matched to a case participant by age, county of residence, and date of testing. EXPOSURES: Adolescents were defined as fully immunized if they had received 2 doses of vaccine at least 14 days before focal time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. The vaccine's effectiveness (VE) was estimated using matched odds ratios from conditional logistic regression models. Secondary measures included estimated VE by clinical symptoms, number of vaccine doses received, and elapsed time from immunization. RESULTS: A total of 6901 adolescents were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample comprised 186 case participants and 356 matched control participants. The median age was 14 (IQR, 13-16) years, 262 (48%) identified as female, 81 (15%) as Black, 82 (15%) as Hispanic, and 297 (55%) as White. Overall, 134 (25%) were fully immunized (case participants, 10 [5%]; control participants, 124 [35%]). The median time between immunization and the SARS-CoV-2 test was 62 days (range, 17-129 days). Within 4 months of receiving 2 doses, VE against any infection was estimated to be 91% (95% CI, 80%-96%); against asymptomatic infection, 85% (95% CI, 57%-95%). Effectiveness after a single dose was estimated to be 74% (95% CI, 18%-92%).

METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among subjects with either solid or hematological cancers who had received two doses of either mRNA or non-mRNA vaccines within 6 months. The levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG and NAb were analyzed using the Mindray Immunoassay Analyzer CL-900i. Statistical analysis was conducted using mean comparison and regression analysis. RESULT: The mRNA-1273 vaccine had the highest median levels of S-RBD IgG and NAb, followed by BNT162b, ChAdOx1nCoV-19, and BBIBP-CorV/Coronavac. The levels of S-RBD IgG and NAb in subjects vaccinated with mRNA vaccines were significantly higher than those of non-mRNA vaccines when grouped based on their characteristics, including age, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and comorbidity (p<0.05). Furthermore, the S-RBD IgG and NAb levels between the subjects vaccinated with non-mRNA vaccines and the subjects vaccinated with mRNA vaccines were significantly different (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the same types of vaccines. This study demonstrated a very strong correlation between the level of S-RBD IgG and the level of NAb (R = 0.962; p<0.001).

We report interim results of the first study evaluating safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in healthy Japanese participants. METHODS: This phase 1/2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted in Japan (two sites), enrolled healthy adults aged >/= 20 years with no prior exposure to investigational coronavirus vaccines/treatments, and no known history/risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were stratified by age (< 65/>/= 65 years) and randomised to receive two doses of 100 mug mRNA-1273 or placebo administered as intramuscular injections 28 days apart. Primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike protein-binding antibody level (bAb). A secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody (nAb) response. RESULTS: Participants were enrolled between 21 January and 3 February 2021, and 200 were randomised: mRNA-1273, n = 150 (< 65 years, n = 100; >/= 65 years, n = 50); placebo, n = 50 (< 65 years, n = 40; >/= 65 years, n = 10). Solicited adverse events (AEs) through 7 days after each vaccination occurred in 144/150 (96%) and 19/50 (38%) participants in the mRNA-1273 and placebo arms, respectively. In the mRNA-1273 arm, injection-site pain, myalgia and fatigue were the most frequently reported solicited AEs after each vaccination, irrespective of age. Robust immune responses occurred with mRNA-1273 (n = 147) with a bAb geometric mean fold rise (95% confidence interval [CI]) from baseline of 1009 (865, 1177) and a nAb of 21.7 (19.8, 23.8) at day 57. Seroconversion rates (95% CI) for bAb and nAb were both 100% (97.5, 100) at day 57. No such response occurred with placebo (n = 49). CONCLUSION: Two doses of 100 mug mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and induced significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in a Japanese population aged >/= 20 years.

European states have ruled out generalized vaccination mandates but have so far preferred to exert a form of \"moral suasion\", through the introduction of a digital certificate which can only be granted to those who are vaccinated, cured of COVID-19 or tested negative through an antigen test in the previous 48 hours. Italy has applied this tool, dubbed \"Green Pass\", very rigorously: many daily activities, including going to work, are only allowed for those who have the certificate. A one-year Green Pass is issued after vaccination, although data show that vaccine protection may subside gradually over about six months; the cost of the antigen tests every 48 hours is to be borne by the patient. Testing the unvaccinated is essential to contain the spread of the infection, but it would have been more logical to mandate that all the unvaccinated undergo regular testing (for example every ten days), instead of imposing a test every 48 hours only to be allowed to engage in some activities. The authors stress that in order to minimize the risk of future possible pandemics, prevention strategies are needed, and poor countries need to be enabled to vaccinate their populations in order to prevent new variants from developing. The pledges made by world leaders in that regard during the recent G20 summit must therefore be honored, for the sake of global health that never in our lifetime has been so threatened.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35113440/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/27891 https://sci-hub.do/10.26355/eurrev_202201_27891", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Italy", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35064899, "aid": "10.1007/s40264-021-01138-z 1138 10.1007/s40264-021-01138-z", "titl": "Spontaneous Reporting to Regulatory Authorities of Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions to COVID-19 Vaccines Over Time: The Effect of Publicity.", "mesh": "*COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Ferner, Robin E; Stevens, Richard J; Anton, Christopher; Aronson, Jeffrey K", "jour": "Drug safety", "affl": "West Midlands Centre for Adverse Drug Reactions, City Hospital, Birmingham, B18 7QH, UK. r.e.ferner@bham.ac.uk.;;; Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK. r.e.ferner@bham.ac.uk.;;; Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Medical Science Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.;;; West Midlands Centre for Adverse Drug Reactions, City Hospital, Birmingham, B18 7QH, UK.;;; Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Medical Science Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.", "pdat": "2022 Feb", "tiab": "INTRODUCTION: The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has published frequent summaries of spontaneous reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (Yellow Cards) to vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The EudraVigilance database has provided similar data for the European Economic Area. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize the evolution over time of spontaneous reports of suspected ADRs to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and to observe the effect of a publicized reaction (cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis [CVST]) on reporting rates. METHODS: We used publicly available data on reports of suspected ADRs and doses of vaccine administered, published by the MHRA, EudraVigilance, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to calculate reporting rates. RESULTS: Approximately 4814 Yellow Card reports (23 fatal) per million doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) and 2890 (13 fatal) per million doses of tozinameran (Pfizer/BioNTech) have been lodged. Between 15 March and 31 October 2021, cumulative European reports of CVST rose from 0 to 443 (183 with thrombocytopenia, 72 fatal) with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and from 2 to 315 (9 with thrombocytopenia, 28 fatal) with tozinameran. European cases of retinal vein occlusion and thrombosis rose from 0 to 168 with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and from 1 to 220 with tozinameran; four of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 cases were associated with thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: Reports of fatal adverse reactions to coronavirus vaccines are very rare. Reports of CVST have been made in relation to both vaccines. Most were submitted after the reaction had been publicized. Thrombocytopenia occurred in a minority of cases.

METHODS: We enrolled healthcare workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care hospital who received homologous two-dose vaccination, followed by a homologous or heterologous booster mRNA vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgG was measured using ELISA. A linear mixed regression model was used to compare the slope from the peak antibody titre to the lowest antibody titres 3 months after vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 113 HCWs (BNT162b2 (n = 48 [42%]), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n = 52 [46%]) or mRNA-1273 (n = 13 [12%])) were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. More gradual antibody waning was observed over 3 months with the two-dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (ChAdOx1) than with the two-dose BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). In addition, homologous mRNA-1273 booster induced a more durable antibody response than homologous BNT162b2 booster (p < 0.001) or heterologous ChAdOx1-BNT162b2 booster (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Two-dose homologous ChAdOx1 vaccination or homologous mRNA-1273 booster appears to induce more-durable antibody responses than 2-dose homologous mRNA vaccination, homologous BNT162b2 booster, or 2-dose ChAdOx1 followed by BNT62b2 booster, although our findings are based on the relatively short term (3-month) follow-up after the vaccinations and the evaluation of the slopes from different antibody peak levels.

SETTING: Linked primary care, hospital, and covid-19 surveillance records available within the OpenSAFELY-TPP research platform, covering a period when the SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants were dominant. PARTICIPANTS: 3 237 918 adults who received a booster dose of either vaccine between 29 October 2021 and 25 February 2022 as part of the national booster programme in England and who received a primary course of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1. INTERVENTION: Vaccination with either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 as a booster vaccine dose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive test, covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related death, and non-covid-19 related death at 20 weeks after receipt of the booster dose. RESULTS: 1 618 959 people were matched in each vaccine group, contributing a total 64 546 391 person weeks of follow-up. The 20 week risks per 1000 for a positive SARS-CoV-2 test were 164.2 (95% confidence interval 163.3 to 165.1) for BNT162b2 and 159.9 (159.0 to 160.8) for mRNA-1273; the hazard ratio comparing mRNA-1273 with BNT162b2 was 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 0.96). The 20 week risks per 1000 for hospital admission with covid-19 were 0.75 (0.71 to 0.79) for BNT162b2 and 0.65 (0.61 to 0.69) for mRNA-1273; the hazard ratio was 0.89 (0.82 to 0.95). Covid-19 related deaths were rare: the 20 week risks per 1000 were 0.028 (0.021 to 0.037) for BNT162b2 and 0.024 (0.018 to 0.033) for mRNA-1273; hazard ratio 0.83 (0.58 to 1.19).

Aim of the study was to evaluate the antibody level against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients treated with two different mRNA-based vaccines, in a multicenter survey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since April 2020, in the 5 participating Centers, periodic screening of all patients with PCR testing has been performed every 2 weeks. The study included two cohorts of patients on maintenance hemodialysis treated with the BNT162b2 or with the mRNA-1273 Covid-19 vaccine. The tests for antibodies against the receptor-binding domain was performed by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S enzyme immunoassay (Roche Elecsys). RESULTS: Of the 398 included patients, 303 received the BNT162b2 and 95 the mRNA-1273 vaccine. In patients without previous infection, the median levels of anti-S antibodies were 297 U/mL and 1,032 U/mL for those treated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, respectively (p < 0.001). In patients with previous infection, the median levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibodies were 7,516 U/mL and 17,495 U/mL for those treated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, respectively (p = 0.005). The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was significantly associated with protective levels of anti-spike IgG, with 3.6% of low- or non-responders having a CCI of 2-4 versus 18.9% in those with a CCI of 8 or more. The adjusted OR of developing a sufficient antibody level between the two vaccines was 3.91 (p = 0.0766) in favor of mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS: Both of the evaluated mRNA-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 showed good efficacy.

Although vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease, data on antibody titers achieved by vaccination is scarce in cancer patients. METHODS: We collected 79 blood samples (69 lung cancer patients and 10 control individuals) and conducted an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay to compare the antibody titer achieved with current treatment. Sixty-eight patients (86%) received the BNT162 mRNA vaccine and 11 (14%) received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. They were categorized according to the current treatment: control individuals without cancer (cohort A), lung cancer patients who were treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (cohort B), immunotherapy (cohort C), combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and immunotherapy (cohort D), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (cohort E), and radiation therapy (cohort F). RESULTS: Among 69 lung cancer patients (cohort B-F), 57 (83%) had adenocarcinoma, and 66 (96%) had advanced-stage cancer. In the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay, the antibody titer was significantly lower in lung cancer patients than in control individuals (p = 0.01). The median antibody titers were 161 AU/ml in control individuals and 59.9 AU/ml in lung cancer patients.

The incidence rate ratio and excess number of hospital admissions or deaths from myocarditis per million people were estimated for the 1 to 28 days after sequential doses of adenovirus (ChAdOx1) or mRNA-based (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273) vaccines, or after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: In 42 842 345 people receiving at least 1 dose of vaccine, 21 242 629 received 3 doses, and 5 934 153 had SARS-CoV-2 infection before or after vaccination. Myocarditis occurred in 2861 (0.007%) people, with 617 events 1 to 28 days after vaccination. Risk of myocarditis was increased in the 1 to 28 days after a first dose of ChAdOx1 (incidence rate ratio, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.09-1.62]) and a first, second, and booster dose of BNT162b2 (1.52 [95% CI, 1.24-1.85]; 1.57 [95% CI, 1.28-1.92], and 1.72 [95% CI, 1.33-2.22], respectively) but was lower than the risks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test before or after vaccination (11.14 [95% CI, 8.64-14.36] and 5.97 [95% CI, 4.54-7.87], respectively). The risk of myocarditis was higher 1 to 28 days after a second dose of mRNA-1273 (11.76 [95% CI, 7.25-19.08]) and persisted after a booster dose (2.64 [95% CI, 1.25-5.58]).

We examined the effect of vaccination time of day on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer after the first dose of vaccination with the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine in an adult population. A total of 332 Japanese adults participated in the present study. All participants were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 and had already received the first dose of mRNA-1273 2 to 4 weeks prior to participating in the study. The participants were asked to provide basic demographic characteristics (age, sex, medical history, allergy, medication, and mean sleep duration), the number of days after the first dose of vaccination, and the time of day of vaccination. Blood was collected from the participants, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were measured. Ordinary least square regression was used for assessing the relationship between basic demographic characteristics, number of days after vaccination, time of day of vaccination, and the log(10)-transformed normalized antibody titer. The least square mean of antibody titers was not associated with the vaccination time and sleep durations. The least square means of antibody titers was associated with age; the antibody titers decreased in people aged 50 to 59 years and 60 to 64 years. The present findings demonstrate that the vaccination time with mRNA-1273 was not associated with the SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer in an adult population, suggesting that these results do not support restricting vaccination to a particular time of day.

This study aimed to compare reactogenicity and NAbs generated by three different COVID-19 vaccine platforms in individuals with and without prior COVID-19. 336 individuals vaccinated (112 with CoronaVac [inactivated virus], 112 with BNT162b2 [messenger RNA], and 112 with Ad5-nCoV [non-replicating viral vector]) were included. NAbs were quantified with the cPass SARS-CoV-2 kit. Individuals immunized with the Ad5-nCoV showed higher reactogenicity than those immunized with the other vaccines (p < 0.001). The BTN162b2 vaccine-induced NAbs with higher inhibition capacity than the other platforms in the first dose. In individuals without prior COVID-19, the Ad5-nCoV vaccine generated lower NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 than those induced by two doses of the BTN162b2 (Ad5-nCoV 72.10 [55.6-93.4] vs. BTN162b2 98.41 [98.16-98.56], p < 0.0001). One individual did not generate NAbs (0.89%) after a complete immunization with CoronaVac; in BTN162b2, all generated these antibodies, and in the Ad5-nCoV group, four individuals (3.57%) did not generate NAbs. Comorbidities, gender, age, and reactogenicity did not significantly influence the generation of NAbs (p > 0.05); however, a history of COVID-19 before vaccination was associated with antibodies with greater neutralizing capacity after the first dose (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the mRNA vaccine (BTN162b2) had a remarkable better ability to produce NAbs and lower reactogenicity than the other platforms, whereas the Ad5-nCov vaccine induced the lowest NAbs response in individuals without a history of COVID-19; therefore, we suggest that a booster could benefit these individuals.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36279685/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0165-2478(22)00141-9 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.imlet.2022.10.002", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Netherlands", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35027756, "aid": "10.1038/s41591-021-01666-2 1666 10.1038/s41591-021-01666-2", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination rates in pregnant women in Scotland.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Pregnancy;;; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; Pregnant Women;;; Prospective Studies;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccination", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Stock, Sarah J; Carruthers, Jade; Calvert, Clara; Denny, Cheryl; Donaghy, Jack; Goulding, Anna; Hopcroft, Lisa E M; Hopkins, Leanne; McLaughlin, Terry; Pan, Jiafeng; Shi, Ting; Taylor, Bob; Agrawal, Utkarsh; Auyeung, Bonnie; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; McCowan, Colin; Murray, Josie; Simpson, Colin R; Robertson, Chris; Vasileiou, Eleftheria; Sheikh, Aziz; Wood, Rachael", "jour": "Nature medicine", "affl": "University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK. sarah.stock@ed.ac.uk.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK. sarah.stock@ed.ac.uk.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; The DataLab, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.;;; School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; MRC/CSO Social & Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.;;; School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.;;; Institute of Health & Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; School of Health, Wellington Faculty of Health, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.", "pdat": "2022 Mar", "tiab": "Population-level data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes are lacking.

Here, we proposed to analyse the humoral immune response elicited by the primary vaccines used in Argentina from July-December 2021. METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD IgG and neutralising antibodies were assayed by ELISA in a total of 871 serum samples obtained from 376 volunteers from an educational staff. The individuals were vaccinated with BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, AZ), Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V, SpV) or combined vaccines (mostly SpV and mRNA-1273, Moderna). The antibody response was analysed several days after the initial vaccination (20, 40, 120 and 180\u202fdays). RESULTS: After receiving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, we detected 93.34% of seroprevalence. Previously SARS-CoV-2 infected showed higher antibody concentrations compared with naive vaccinees. Six months after the initial vaccination, combined vaccination induced higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels than the other vaccines in naive volunteers. However, we did not find differences in the neutralising responses after any vaccine from naive vaccines or between the naive and previously infected volunteers on day 120 after vaccination.

METHODS: HEMVACO was a prospective, multicentric study registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04852796. Patients received two or three doses of BNT162b2 vaccine or mRNA-1273 vaccine. The SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG titers were measured 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the second dose. RESULTS: Only 16 patients (11.6%) were naive of hematological treatment and 77 patients (55.8%) were on active treatment for hemopathy. Among the 138 analyzed patients, positive antibody titer at 1 month was obtained in 68.1% of patients with mean serology at 850+/-883 BAU/ml. Risk factors for vaccine failure were anti-CD20 therapy (OR=111[14.3-873]; P<0.001), hypogammaglobulinemia under 8g/L (OR=2.49[1.05-5.92]; P=0.032) and lymphopenia under 1.5G/L (OR=2.47[1.18-5.17]; P=0.015). Anti-CD20 therapy induced no anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion (96%). Seventy-eight patients (56.5%) received a third dose and could reach the SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG titer of high-risk patients (P=0.54). The median titer at 379 BAU/ml distinguished two groups of vaccine response (99+/-121 BAU/ml versus 1,109+/-678 BAU/ml). CONCLUSION: Vaccination should be performed before anti-CD20 therapy if the hemopathy treatment can be delayed.

The second dose is currently recommended at an extended gap after the infection, but the information available regarding response to the second dose in this subgroup is limited. Patients with AIRDs previously infected with COVID-19, who have received at least one dose of AZD1222/ChAdOx1 (n = 200) were included and stratified based on vaccine doses (V), and infection (I) into I + V, I + V + V, V + I, V + V + I. Anti-RBD (receptor binding domain) antibodies were compared across the four groups. In 49 patients of the I + V + V group (AZD12222), paired sera were compared for antibody levels and neutralization after each vaccine dose. Thirty patients with hybrid immunity after BBV152 and 25 with complete vaccination without infection were included as controls. The highest anti-RBD antibody levels were observed in the V + V + I group (18,219 +/- 7702 IU/ml) with statistically similar titers in the I + V + V (10,392 +/- 8514 IU/ml) and the I + V (8801 +/- 8122 IU/ml). This was confirmed in the 49 paired samples that paradoxically showed a lowering of antibody titers after the second dose [9626 (IQR: 4575-18,785)-5781 (2484-11,906); p < 0.001]. Neutralization of the Delta variant was unaffected but Omicron neutralization was significantly reduced after the second dose [45.7 (5.3-86.53)-35% (7.3-70.9); p = 0.028]. Ancillary analyses showed that only the hybrid immune sera could neutralize the Omicron variant and AZD1222 hybrids performed better than BBV152 hybrids. The second dose of AZD1222 did not boost antibody titers in patients with RD who had COVID-19 previously.

METHODS: We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron and delta (B.1.617.2) variants in England. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated after primary immunization with two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and after a booster dose of BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or mRNA-1273. RESULTS: Between November 27, 2021, and January 12, 2022, a total of 886,774 eligible persons infected with the omicron variant, 204,154 eligible persons infected with the delta variant, and 1,572,621 eligible test-negative controls were identified. At all time points investigated and for all combinations of primary course and booster vaccines, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease was higher for the delta variant than for the omicron variant. No effect against the omicron variant was noted from 20 weeks after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 doses, whereas vaccine effectiveness after two BNT162b2 doses was 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.9 to 67.0) at 2 to 4 weeks, dropping to 8.8% (95% CI, 7.0 to 10.5) at 25 or more weeks. Among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 62.4% (95% CI, 61.8 to 63.0) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before decreasing to 39.6% (95% CI, 38.0 to 41.1) at 10 or more weeks. Among BNT162b2 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 67.2% (95% CI, 66.5 to 67.8) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before declining to 45.7% (95% CI, 44.7 to 46.7) at 10 or more weeks. Vaccine effectiveness after a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course increased to 70.1% (95% CI, 69.5 to 70.7) at 2 to 4 weeks after an mRNA-1273 booster and decreased to 60.9% (95% CI, 59.7 to 62.1) at 5 to 9 weeks. After a BNT162b2 primary course, the mRNA-1273 booster increased vaccine effectiveness to 73.9% (95% CI, 73.1 to 74.6) at 2 to 4 weeks; vaccine effectiveness fell to 64.4% (95% CI, 62.6 to 66.1) at 5 to 9 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Primary immunization with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 vaccine provided limited protection against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant. A BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 booster after either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 primary course substantially increased protection, but that protection waned over time.

To effectively utilize these vaccines, clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate their safety and efficacy. For efficacy evaluation, prevention rate of symptomatic novel coronavirus infections (corona virus disease 2019; COVID-19) between placebo groups and investigational vaccine groups has been the key parameter to evaluate the novel COVID-19 vaccines. This approach is based on a consensus among international regulatory authorities. Compared to several months ago, the public vaccination campaign for COVID-19 has substantially progressed in many countries. This makes it difficult to conduct clinical trials, which have placebo control arms, anywhere in the world because of ethical problems in administering a placebo during a pandemic. Therefore, the new international consensus among regulatory authorities is that immunogenicity bridging studies between the new COVID-19 vaccines that are being developed and approved COVID-19 vaccines may be needed when placebo-controlled studies are no longer feasible.

The persistence of antibody responses was quantified through mechanistic modeling-based simulations. Two biomarkers of humoral immune responses were examined: SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies determined by wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA) and spike protein-binding antibodies determined by indirect spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA). The persistence of antibody responses was defined as the period of time during which wtVNA and S-ELISA titers remained above the lower limit of quantification. A total of 442 wtVNA and 1,185 S-ELISA titers from 82 and 220 participants, respectively, were analyzed following administration of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5 x 10(10) viral particles). The mechanistic model adequately described the time course of observed wtVNA and S-ELISA serum titers and its associated variability up to 8 months following vaccination. Mechanistic model-based simulations show that single-dose Ad26.COV2.S elicits durable but waning antibody responses up to 24 months following immunization. Of the estimated model parameters, the production rate of memory B cells was decreased in older adults relative to younger adults, and the antibody production rate mediated by long-lived plasma cells was increased in women relative to men.

OBJECTIVES: To report statewide trends in vaccine administration and vaccine effectiveness in Minnesota. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used COVID-19 vaccine data from the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection from October 25, 2020, through October 30, 2021 that were linked with electronic health record (EHR) data from health systems collaborating as part of the Minnesota EHR Consortium (MNEHRC). Participants included individuals who were seen at a participating health system in Minnesota. EXPOSURES: Individuals were considered fully vaccinated in the second week after receipt of a second dose of a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine or a single dose of an Ad26.COV.2.S vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A completed vaccination series and vaccine breakthrough, defined as either a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or a hospital admission the same week or within the 3 weeks following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. A test-negative design and incident rate ratio were used to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness separately for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV.2.S vaccines. Rurality and social vulnerability index were assessed at the area level. RESULTS: This study included 4\u202f431\u202f190 unique individuals at participating health systems, and 3\u202f013\u202f704 (68%) of the individuals were fully vaccinated. Vaccination rates were lowest among Minnesotans who identified as Hispanic (116\u202f422 of 217\u202f019 [54%]), multiracial (30\u202f066 of 57\u202f412 [52%]), American Indian or Alaska Native (22\u202f190 of 41\u202f437 [54%]), and Black or African American (158\u202f860 of 326\u202f595 [49%]) compared with Minnesotans who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander (159\u202f999 of 210\u202f994 [76%]) or White (2\u202f402\u202f928 of 3\u202f391\u202f747 [71%]). Among individuals aged 19 to 64 years, vaccination rates were lower in rural areas (196\u202f479 of 308\u202f047 [64%]) compared with urban areas (151\u202f541 of 1\u202f951\u202f265 [77%]) and areas with high social vulnerability (544\u202f433 of 774\u202f952 [70%]) compared with areas with low social vulnerability (571\u202f613 of 724\u202f369 [79%]). In the 9 weeks ending October 30, 2021, vaccine effectiveness as assessed by a test-negative design was 33% (95% CI, 30%-37%) for Ad26.COV.2.S; 53% (95% CI, 52%-54%) for BNT162b2; and 66% (95% CI, 65%-67%) for mRNA-1273. For SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations, vaccine effectiveness in the 9 weeks ending October 30, 2021, was 78% (95% CI, 75%-81%) for Ad26.COV.2.S; 81% (95% CI, 79%-82%) for BNT162b2; and 81% (95% CI, 79%-82%) for mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of data from a Minnesota statewide consortium suggests disparities in vaccine administration and effectiveness.

Since firstly reported by World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2021, Omicron variant has been spreading rapidly and has become the dominant variant in many countries worldwide. Omicron is the most mutated variant so far, containing 60 mutations in its genome, including 37 mutations in the S-protein. Since all current COVID-19 vaccines in use were developed based on ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strains, whether they are protective against Omicron is a critical question which has been the center of study currently. In this article, we systemically reviewed the studies regarding the effectiveness of 2- or 3-dose vaccines delivered in either homologous or heterologous manner. The humoral and cellular immune responses elicited by various vaccine regimens to protect against Omicron variant are discussed. Current understanding of the molecular basis underlying immune escape of Omicron was also analyzed. These studies indicate that two doses of vaccination are insufficient to elicit neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron variant. Nevertheless, Omicron-specific humoral immune responses can be enhanced by booster dose of almost all type vaccines in certain degree, and heterologous vaccination strategy may represent a better choice than homogenous regimens. Intriguingly, results of studies indicate that all current vaccines are still able to elicit robust T cell response against Omicron. Future focus should be the development of Omicron variant vaccine, which may induce potent humoral as well as cellular immune responses simultaneously against all known variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35874952/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/ijbsv18p4629 https://sci-hub.do/10.7150/ijbs.73583", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review", "pl": "Australia", "topic": 0, "prop": 0.9733948989244475}, {"uid": 35918782, "aid": "6653543 ciac635 10.1093/cid/ciac635", "titl": "Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) Vaccine Effectiveness Against Symptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection During Delta-Dominant and Omicron-Dominant Periods in Japan: A Multicenter Prospective Case-control Study (Factors Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines Study).", "mesh": "Humans;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Japan/epidemiology;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; Case-Control Studies;;; Vaccine Efficacy;;; RNA, Messenger", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Arashiro, Takeshi; Arima, Yuzo; Muraoka, Hirokazu; Sato, Akihiro; Oba, Kunihiro; Uehara, Yuki; Arioka, Hiroko; Yanai, Hideki; Kuramochi, Jin; Ihara, Genei; Chubachi, Kumi; Yanagisawa, Naoki; Nagura, Yoshito; Kato, Yasuyuki; Ueda, Akihiro; Numata, Akira; Kato, Hideaki; Ishii, Koji; Ooki, Takao; Oka, Hideaki; Nishida, Yusuke; Stucky, Ashley; Smith, Chris; Hibberd, Martin; Ariyoshi, Koya; Suzuki, Motoi", "jour": "Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America", "affl": "Center for Surveillance, Immunization, and Epidemiologic Research, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.;;; School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.;;; Center for Surveillance, Immunization, and Epidemiologic Research, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Clinic for Tamachi, Tokyo, Japan.;;; KARADA Internal Medicine Clinic, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Department of Pediatrics, Showa General Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Department of Clinical Laboratory, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Department of General Internal Medicine, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Fukujuji Hospital, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Kiyose, Japan.;;; Kuramochi Clinic Interpark, Tochigi, Japan.;;; Machida Ekimae Naika Clinic, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Chubachi Internal Respiratory Medicine Clinic, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Yanagisawa Clinic, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Shinjuku Home Clinic, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Department of Infectious Diseases, International University of Health and Welfare Narita Hospital, Chiba, Japan.;;; Department of Infectious Diseases, Japanese Red Cross Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Ikebukuro Metropolitan Clinic, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Infection Prevention and Control Department, Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.;;; Saitama Sekishinkai Hospital, Saitama, Japan.;;; Saitama Sekishinkai Hospital, Saitama, Japan.;;; Department of General Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.;;; Department of General Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.;;; Center for Surveillance, Immunization, and Epidemiologic Research, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.;;; Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.;;; School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.;;; Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.;;; School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.;;; Center for Surveillance, Immunization, and Epidemiologic Research, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.", "pdat": "2023 Feb 8", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Although several coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines initially showed high efficacy, there have been concerns because of waning immunity and the emergence of variants with immune escape capacity. METHODS: A test-negative design case-control study was conducted in 16 healthcare facilities in Japan during the Delta-dominant period (August-September 2021) and the Omicron-dominant period (January-March 2022). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was calculated for 2 doses for the Delta-dominant period and 2 or 3 doses for the Omicron-dominant period compared with unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: The analysis included 5795 individuals with 2595 (44.8%) cases. Among vaccinees, 2242 (55.8%) received BNT162b2 and 1624 (40.4%) received messenger RNA (mRNA)-1273 at manufacturer-recommended intervals. During the Delta-dominant period, VE was 88% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82-93) 14 days to 3 months after dose 2 and 87% (95% CI, 38-97) 3 to 6 months after dose 2. During the Omicron-dominant period, VE was 56% (95% CI, 37-70) 14 days to 3 months since dose 2, 52% (95% CI, 40-62) 3 to 6 months after dose 2, 49% (95% CI, 34-61) 6+ months after dose 2, and 74% (95% CI, 62-83) 14+ days after dose 3. Restricting to individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 and additional adjustment for preventive measures (ie, mask wearing/high-risk behaviors) yielded similar estimates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, where most are infection-naive, and strict prevention measures are maintained regardless of vaccination status, 2-dose mRNA vaccines provided high protection against symptomatic infection during the Delta-dominant period and moderate protection during the Omicron-dominant period.

METHODS: In this rapid living systematic evidence synthesis and meta-analysis, we searched EMBASE and the US National Institutes of Health's iSearch COVID-19 Portfolio, supplemented by manual searches of COVID-19-specific sources, until Dec 1, 2022, for studies that reported vaccine effectiveness immediately and at least 112 days after a primary vaccine series or at least 84 days after a booster dose. Single reviewers assessed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles, and extracted data, with a second reviewer verifying included studies. The primary outcomes were vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, and mortality, which were assessed using three-level meta-analytic models. This study is registered with the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools, review 473. FINDINGS: We screened 16 696 records at the title and abstract level, appraised 832 (5.0%) full texts, and initially included 73 (0.4%) studies. Of these, we excluded five (7%) studies because of critical risk of bias, leaving 68 (93%) studies that were extracted for analysis. For infections caused by any SARS-CoV-2 strain, vaccine effectiveness for the primary series reduced from 83% (95% CI 80-86) at baseline (14-42 days) to 62% (53-69) by 112-139 days. Vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 92% (88-94) for hospitalisations and 91% (85-95) for mortality, and reduced to 79% (65-87) at 224-251 days for hospitalisations and 86% (73-93) at 168-195 days for mortality. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was lower for the omicron variant for infections, hospitalisations, and mortality at baseline compared with that of other variants, but subsequent reductions occurred at a similar rate across variants. For booster doses, which covered mostly omicron studies, vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 70% (56-80) against infections and 89% (82-93) against hospitalisations, and reduced to 43% (14-62) against infections and 71% (51-83) against hospitalisations at 112 days or later. Not enough studies were available to report on booster vaccine effectiveness against mortality. INTERPRETATION: Our analyses indicate that vaccine effectiveness generally decreases over time against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, and mortality. The baseline vaccine effectiveness levels for the omicron variant were notably lower than for other variants. Therefore, other preventive measures (eg, face-mask wearing and physical distancing) might be necessary to manage the pandemic in the long term.

Asymptomatic subjects (n = 100) were recruited prior to their first COVID-19 vaccination. Questionnaires were administered to capture a range of demographic and clinical characteristics. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing. Serological assays were performed to detect spike (S)-reactive IgG and IgA and to assess virus neutralization.

Among different therapeutic strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccines are the most promising approach for curbing the pandemic. They elicit an immune neutralizing response and thus offer protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, some questions regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines have been raised and based on sparse reports of severe systemic reactions after vaccination. Among these, evidences on the potential effect of vaccination on the acute rise in blood pressure have been recently accrued. Approved vaccines in Europe increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells. Once synthetized in the cells reached by the vaccine, the Spike proteins first assemble in the cytoplasm and then migrate to the cell surface to protrude with a native-like conformation. Spike proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response. Furthermore, the Spike proteins assembled in the cells which are eventually destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood as free-floating forms. Free-floating Spike proteins may interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors leading to internalization, degradation, and dysregulation of the catalytic activities of these receptors. The consequent loss of ACE2 receptor activity leads to a rapid drop in the generation of angiotensin1,7 resulting from inactivation of angiotensin II. The imbalance between angiotensin II (overactivity) and of angiotensin1,7 (deficiency) might play a role in the genesis of acute elevation in blood pressure.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985455/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1714/3715.37055", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Italy", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35313785, "aid": "10.1080/14760584.2022.2056025", "titl": "Current status of COVID-19 vaccination: safety and liability concern for children, pregnant and lactating women.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;;; Child;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Lactation;;; Pregnancy;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccination", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Das, Swagat Kumar; Paul, Manish; Behera, Bikash Chandra; Thatoi, Hrudayanath", "jour": "Expert review of vaccines", "affl": "Department of Biotechnology, Odisha University of Technology and Research, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.;;; Department of Biotechnology, Maharaja Sriram Chandra Bhanja Deo University, Baripada, India.;;; School of Biological Sciences, National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India.;;; Department of Biotechnology, Maharaja Sriram Chandra Bhanja Deo University, Baripada, India.", "pdat": "2022 Jun", "tiab": "INTRODUCTION: Since its inception, Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has claimed a significant number of lives around the world. AREA COVERED: COVID-19 vaccine development involves several vaccine platforms, including traditional live-attenuated or killed viral particles, viral vectors or DNA, and mRNA-based vaccines. The efficacy and effectiveness (EV) of these vaccines must be assessed in order to determine the extent to which they can protect us against infection. Despite the fact that some affluent countries attempted to vaccinate the majority of their inhabitants, children and pregnant women were first excluded. EXPERT OPINION: While the severity of COVID-19 is less severe in children, the COVID-19-related complications are more severe.SARS-CoV-2 infection is also dangerous for pregnant women. The key to limiting disease spread is early discovery, isolation, and the development of safe and efficient vaccinations. As a result, the purpose of this study is to highlight the current development of various COVID-19 vaccine platforms for different groups of people at higher risk of COVID-19, with a special focus on children, pregnant and lactating women, as well as structural and pathogenicity elements of SARS CoV-2.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35313785/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1080/14760584.2022.2056025", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36864253, "aid": "10.1038/s41591-023-02228-4 10.1038/s41591-023-02228-4", "titl": "Predicting the efficacy of variant-modified COVID-19 vaccine boosters.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; Antibodies, Viral", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Khoury, David S; Docken, Steffen S; Subbarao, Kanta; Kent, Stephen J; Davenport, Miles P; Cromer, Deborah", "jour": "Nature medicine", "affl": "Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;;; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;;; WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.;;; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.;;; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.;;; Melbourne Sexual Health Centre and Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Hospital and Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.;;; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;;; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. d.cromer@unsw.edu.au.", "pdat": "2023 Mar", "tiab": "Booster vaccination for the prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is required to overcome loss of protection due to waning immunity and the spread of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants.

Using these data, we compare the immunogenicity of different vaccination regimens and predict the relative protection of booster vaccines under different scenarios. We predict that boosting with ancestral vaccines can markedly enhance protection against both symptomatic and severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses, although variant-modified vaccines may provide additional protection, even if not matched to the circulating variants.

Vaccination programmes are being rolled out globally, but most of these vaccines have been approved without extensive studies on their side-effects and efficacy. Recently, new-onset autoimmune phenomena after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported increasingly (e.g. immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, autoimmune liver diseases, Guillain-Barre syndrome, IgA nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus). Molecular mimicry, the production of particular autoantibodies and the role of certain vaccine adjuvants seem to be substantial contributors to autoimmune phenomena.

Here, we summarize the emerging evidence about autoimmune manifestations occurring in response to certain COVID-19 vaccines. Although information pertaining to the risk of autoimmune disease as a consequence of vaccination is controversial, we merely propose our current understanding of autoimmune manifestations associated with COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, we do not aim to disavow the overwhelming benefits of mass COVID-19 vaccination in preventing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. These reports could help guide clinical assessment and management of autoimmune manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957554/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1111/imm.13443", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review", "pl": "England", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36106642, "aid": "160565 10.1172/JCI160565", "titl": "Durability of protection and immunogenicity of AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) COVID-19 vaccine over 6 months.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/prevention & control;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccination", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Maaske, Jill; Falsey, Ann R; Sproule, Stephanie; Robb, Merlin L; Frenck, Robert W Jr; Tieu, Hong-Van; Mayer, Kenneth H; Corey, Lawrence; Neuzil, Kathleen M; Tong, Tina; Brewinski Isaacs, Margaret; Janes, Holly; Bansal, Himanshu; Edwards, Lindsay M; Green, Justin A; Kelly, Elizabeth J; Shoemaker, Kathryn; Takas, Therese; White, Tom; Bhuyan, Prakash; Villafana, Tonya; Hirsch, And Ian", "jour": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "affl": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.;;; Clinical Development, Vaccines & Immune Therapies, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.;;; University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester Regional Health, Rochester, New York, USA.;;; Biometrics, Vaccines & Immune Therapies, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.;;; Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.;;; Division of Infectious Diseases, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.;;; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.;;; Lindsley F.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antinucleocapsid antibody (anti-N Ab) seropositivity in mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccinees with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Nested substudy of a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04470427). SETTING: 99 sites in the United States, July 2020 through March 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were aged 18 years or older, had no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and were at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19. Substudy participants were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the trial's blinded phase. INTERVENTION: 2 mRNA-1273 or placebo injections 28 days apart. MEASUREMENTS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from days 1 and 29 (vaccination days) and from symptom-prompted illness visits were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum samples from days 1, 29, and 57 and the participant decision visit (PDV, when participants were informed of treatment assignment; median day 149) were tested for anti-N Abs by the Elecsys immunoassay. RESULTS: Among 812 participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 illness during the blinded phase of the trial (through March 2021), seroconversion to anti-N Abs (median of 53 days after diagnosis) occurred in 21 of 52 mRNA-1273 vaccinees (40% [95% CI, 27% to 54%]) versus 605 of 648 placebo recipients (93% [CI, 92% to 95%]). Each 1-log increase in SARS-CoV-2 viral copies at diagnosis was associated with 90% higher odds of anti-N Ab seroconversion (odds ratio, 1.90 [CI, 1.59 to 2.28]). LIMITATION: The scope was restricted to mRNA-1273 vaccinees and the Elecsys assay, the sample size was small, data on Delta and Omicron infections were lacking, and the analysis did not address a prespecified objective of the trial. CONCLUSION: Vaccination status should be considered when interpreting seroprevalence and seropositivity data based solely on anti-N Ab testing.

Several acquired SARS-CoV-2 mutations reflect viral adaptations to host immune defence. Mutations in the virus Spike-protein were associated with the lowered effectiveness of current preventive therapies, including vaccines. Recent in vitro studies detected diminished neutralisation capacity of vaccine-induced antibodies, which are targeted to bind Spike receptor-binding and N-terminal domains in the emerging strains.

However, uncertainty remains over how long primary vaccination series remain effective, the ideal timing for booster doses, and the safety of heterologous booster regimens. We aimed to investigate COVID-19 primary vaccine series effectiveness and its waning, and the safety and effectiveness of booster doses, in a UK community setting. METHODS: We used SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in individuals from a longitudinal, prospective, community-based study (ZOE COVID Study), in which data were self-reported through an app, to assess the effectiveness of three COVID-19 vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCov19 [Oxford-AstraZeneca], BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNtech], and mRNA1273 [Moderna]) against infection in the 8 months after completion of primary vaccination series. In individuals receiving boosters, we investigated vaccine effectiveness and reactogenicity, by assessing 16 self-reported systemic and localised side-effects. We used multivariate Poisson regression models adjusting for confounders to estimate vaccine effectiveness. FINDINGS: We included 620 793 participants who received two vaccine doses (204 731 [33.0%] received BNT162b2, 405 239 [65.3%] received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and 10 823 [1.7%] received mRNA-1273) and subsequently had a SARS-CoV-2 test result between May 23 (chosen to exclude the period of alpha [B.1.1.7] variant dominance) and Nov 23, 2021. 62 172 (10.0%) vaccinated individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were compared with 40 345 unvaccinated controls (6726 [16.7%] of whom tested positive). Vaccine effectiveness waned after the second dose: at 5 months, BNT162b2 effectiveness was 82.1% (95% CI 81.3-82.9), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 effectiveness was 75.7% (74.9-76.4), and mRNA-1273 effectiveness was 84.3% (81.2-86.9). Vaccine effectiveness decreased more among individuals aged 55 years or older and among those with comorbidities. 135 932 individuals aged 55 years or older received a booster (2123 [1.6%] of whom tested positive). Vaccine effectiveness for booster doses in 0-3 months after BNT162b2 primary vaccination was higher than 92.5%, and effectiveness for heterologous boosters after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was at least 88.8%. For the booster reactogenicity analysis, in 317 011 participants, the most common systemic symptom was fatigue (in 31 881 [10.1%] participants) and the most common local symptom was tenderness (in 187 767 [59.2%]). Systemic side-effects were more common for heterologous schedules (32 632 [17.9%] of 182 374) than for homologous schedules (17 707 [13.2%] of 134 637; odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.5-1.6, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: After 5 months, vaccine effectiveness remained high among individuals younger than 55 years. Booster doses restore vaccine effectiveness. Adverse reactions after booster doses were similar to those after the second dose. Homologous booster schedules had fewer reported systemic side-effects than heterologous boosters.

METHODS: Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine and Oxford-Astra Zenecaa chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine have been approved to be used in Kuwait since December 2021. PWMS registered in Kuwait national registry were contacted by phone, WhatsApp, or through face-to-face interviews and were invited to complete our questionnaire. Demographic, clinical data, symptoms following the vaccine, worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms, and occurrence of relapse were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 820 PWMS, 647 completed the questionnaire. Between January 2021 and 31 August 2021, 383 (59.28%) PWMS received at least one dose of the approved vaccinations versus 63.4% of the general population on the same date. Their mean age was 36.82 + 8.80, and most of them, 247 (64.3%), were females. A total of 356 vaccinated cohorts (92.6%) were treated with disease-modifying therapies. Adverse events were reported by 261 (68.15%) subjects. One case of COVID-19 infection was encountered after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Twenty-one (5.48%) cases reported worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms after the vaccine. Five patients (1.31%) reported relapse after the COVID-19 vaccine. The most common adverse events of the COVID-19 vaccine were pain at the injection site, fatigue, low-grade fever, and body ache; and resolved within one week. There was no significant association between use of disease modifying therapy (DMT) and COVID-19 vaccine adverse events. CONCLUSION: BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 are safe for PWMS.

Articles included in the review were systematic reviews and meta-analysis, cohort studies, retrospective studies, case-control studies, case series, and reports.

In all, 530 patients were included in the study. Patients received 2 doses at a 4-week interval and a third dose if they were seronegative after the second dose. Response rate was 27% after dose 1 and 52% after dose 2. Post-dose 2 treatment-naive patients had the highest response rate (72%) followed by patients previously treated by chemoimmunotherapy (60%). Among patients receiving therapy, those receiving Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone (22%) or in combination with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or venetoclax (0%) had the poorer response rate whereas patients who received venetoclax monotherapy achieved a significantly higher response rate (52%). A multivariable analysis identified age older than 65 years, ongoing CLL treatment, and gamma globulin </=6 g/L as independent predictors of the absence of seroconversion.

Effectiveness against symptomatic infection >/=7 d after two doses was 89-92% against Alpha, 87% against Beta, 88% against Gamma, 82-89% against Beta/Gamma and 87-95% against Delta across vaccine products. The corresponding estimates >/=14 d after one dose were lower. Effectiveness estimates against hospitalization or death were similar to or higher than against symptomatic infection. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection was generally lower for older adults (>/=60 years) than for younger adults (<60 years) for most of the VOC-vaccine combinations.

Several adverse reactions have been reported with vaccination against COVID-19. It is unknown whether adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are severe in individuals with allergies. METHODS: We administered the COVID-19 vaccine to the medical staff at Yamagata University Hospital from March to August 2021. Subsequently, we conducted an online questionnaire-based survey to investigate the presence of allergy and adverse reactions after vaccination and examine the association between allergy and adverse reactions after immunization. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 1586 to 1306 participants after the first and second administration of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. Adverse reactions included injection site pain, injection site swelling, fever, fatigue or malaise, headache, chills, nausea, muscle pain outside the injection site, and arthralgia. The frequency of some adverse reactions and their severity were higher, and the duration of symptoms was longer in participants with allergies than in those without allergies. Although several participants visited the emergency room for treatment after the first and second vaccinations, no participant was diagnosed with anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the frequency and severity of adverse reactions after injection of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were higher in individuals with allergy; however, no severe adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis or death were observed. These results indicate that individuals with allergic histories may tolerate the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920980/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S2212-5345(21)00195-7 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.resinv.2021.11.007", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Netherlands", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36342000, "aid": "S0272-6386(22)00892-7 10.1053/j.ajkd.2022.07.012", "titl": "Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Occurring After Receipt of mRNA-1273 COVID-19 Vaccine Booster: A Case Report.", "mesh": "Female;;; Humans;;; Adult;;; *Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/genetics/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;;; 2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Claes, Kathleen J; Geerts, Inge; Lemahieu, Wim; Wilmer, Alexander; Kuypers, Dirk R J; Koshy, Priyanka; Ombelet, Sara", "jour": "American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation", "affl": "Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Nephrology and Renal Transplantation Research Group, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

Because of persistent headache, nausea, and general malaise, she went to her general practitioner, who referred her to the hospital after detecting hypertension and acute kidney injury. A diagnosis of TMA was made. Her treatment consisted of blood pressure control, hemodialysis, plasma exchange, and respiratory support. Kidney biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of acute TMA. The patient was referred for treatment with eculizumab, and kidney function improved after initiation of this therapy. Genetic analysis revealed a pathogenic C3 variant. SARS-CoV-2 infection as a trigger for complement activation and development of aHUS has been described previously. In addition, there is one reported case of aHUS occurring after receipt of the adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, but, to our knowledge, this is the first case of aHUS occurring after a booster dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in a patient with an underlying pathogenic variant in complement C3.
