In addition to this, vaccines remain the major mainstay of prevention and protection against infection. Novel vaccines and drugs are constantly being developed to unleash an immune response for the robust targeting of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated variants. In this review, we provide an updated perspective on the current challenges posed by the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 mutants/variants and the evolution of diagnostic techniques to enable their detection.

AIMS: The objective of this study was to provide an up-to-date comparative analysis of the characteristics, adverse events, efficacy, effectiveness and impact of the variants of concern for 19 COVID-19 vaccines. SOURCES: References for this review were identified through searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, regulatory drug agencies and pharmaceutical companies' websites up to 22nd September 2021. CONTENT: Overall, all COVID-19 vaccines had a high efficacy against the original strain and the variants of concern, and were well tolerated. BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and Sputnik V after two doses had the highest efficacy (>90%) in preventing symptomatic cases in phase III trials. mRNA vaccines, AZD1222, and CoronaVac were effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe infections against Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta variants. Regarding observational real-life data, full immunization with mRNA vaccines and AZD1222 seems to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection against the original strain and Alpha and Beta variants but with reduced effectiveness against the Delta strain. A decline in infection protection was observed at 6 months for BNT162b2 and AZD1222. Serious adverse event rates were rare for mRNA vaccines-anaphylaxis 2.5-4.7 cases per million doses, myocarditis 3.5 cases per million doses-and were similarly rare for all other vaccines. Prices for the different vaccines varied from $2.15 to $29.75 per dose. IMPLICATIONS: All vaccines appear to be safe and effective tools to prevent severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death against all variants of concern, but the quality of evidence greatly varies depending on the vaccines considered. Questions remain regarding a booster dose and waning immunity, the duration of immunity, and heterologous vaccination.

As the pandemic has progressed, the understanding of this disease has evolved. OBJECTIVE: This first in a two-part series on COVID-19 updates provides a focused overview of the presentation and evaluation of COVID-19 for emergency clinicians. DISCUSSION: COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several variants exist, including a variant of concern known as Delta (B.1.617.2 lineage) and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 lineage). The Delta variant is associated with higher infectivity and poor patient outcomes, and the Omicron variant has resulted in a significant increase in infections. While over 80% of patients experience mild symptoms, a significant proportion can be critically ill, including those who are older and those with comorbidities. Upper respiratory symptoms, fever, and changes in taste/smell remain the most common presenting symptoms. Extrapulmonary complications are numerous and may be severe, including the cardiovascular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic systems. Emergency department evaluation includes focused testing for COVID-19 and assessment of end-organ injury. Imaging may include chest radiography, computed tomography, or ultrasound. Several risk scores may assist in prognostication, including the 4C (Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium) score, quick COVID Severity Index (qCSI), NEWS2, and the PRIEST score, but these should only supplement and not replace clinical judgment.

There are three major methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their role has evolved during the course of the pandemic. Molecular tests such as PCR are highly sensitive and specific at detecting viral RNA, and are recommended by WHO for confirming diagnosis in individuals who are symptomatic and for activating public health measures. Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others. Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery. With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear.

Herd or community immunity has been proposed as a strategy to protect the vulnerable, and can be established through immunity from past infection or vaccination. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the development of a reservoir of resilient memory cells is under investigation. Vaccines have been developed at an unprecedented rate and 7 408 870 760 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants are more transmissible with a reduced sensitivity to immune mechanisms. This is due to the presence of amino acid substitutions in the spike protein, which confer a selective advantage. The emergence of variants therefore poses a risk for vaccine effectiveness and long-term immunity, and it is crucial therefore to determine the effectiveness of vaccines against currently circulating variants. Here we review both SARS-CoV-2-induced host immune activation and vaccine-induced immune responses, highlighting the responses of immune memory cells that are key indicators of host immunity.

Herein, we review the current status of mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the different approaches used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 variants.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35669787/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fimmu.2022.898192", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35200162, "aid": "00063198-202205000-00005 10.1097/MCP.0000000000000868", "titl": "COVID-19: vaccines, efficacy and effects on variants.", "mesh": "Ad26COVS1;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Humans;;; Pandemics;;; SARS-CoV-2/genetics", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Rudan, Igor; Adeloye, Davies; Sheikh, Aziz", "jour": "Current opinion in pulmonary medicine", "affl": "Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.", "pdat": "2022 May 1", "tiab": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We reviewed three leading strategies of vaccine development against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19): mRNA vaccines, adenoviral vector vaccines and recombinant nanoparticles. We also considered the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and their impact on the effectiveness of the most widely implemented vaccines. RECENT FINDINGS: General properties, efficacy, safety and global uptake of Pfizer/BioNTech's Comirnaty (BNT162b2), Moderna's Spikevax (mRNA-1273), Oxford/AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, J&J/Janssen's Ad26.COV2.S and Novavax's NVX-CoV2373 vaccines at the end of the year 2021 were presented. We summarized the information on the effectiveness against COVID-19 infection, severe disease and death. We then focused on important missense mutations in the five variants of concern (VoC): Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. We explored the evidence for the effectiveness of the vaccines against those five VoC. SUMMARY: It is difficult to predict the further development of the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of vaccines of an increasingly broad spectrum against coronaviruses, more easily deliverable and conferring more durable immune protection is likely. However, the very large number of infections may lead to new mutations with unpredictable impacts. Interventions that would control COVID-19 more effectively and enable a safer coexistence with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its emerging variants are still needed in early 2022.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35200162/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/00063198-202205000-00005 https://sci-hub.do/10.1097/MCP.0000000000000868", "pt": "Journal Article; Review", "pl": "United States", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35172051, "aid": "NJ202202163861302 10.1056/NEJMoa2118691", "titl": "Protection against SARS-CoV-2 after Covid-19 Vaccination and Previous Infection.", "mesh": "*Adaptive Immunity/immunology;;; Asymptomatic Diseases;;; BNT162 Vaccine/therapeutic use;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis/immunology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology/therapeutic use;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/therapeutic use;;; Health Personnel;;; Humans;;; Prospective Studies;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; United Kingdom;;; Vaccination/methods;;; Vaccine Efficacy", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Hall, Victoria; Foulkes, Sarah; Insalata, Ferdinando; Kirwan, Peter; Saei, Ayoub; Atti, Ana; Wellington, Edgar; Khawam, Jameel; Munro, Katie; Cole, Michelle; Tranquillini, Caio; Taylor-Kerr, Andrew; Hettiarachchi, Nipunadi; Calbraith, Davina; Sajedi, Noshin; Milligan, Iain; Themistocleous, Yrene; Corrigan, Diane; Cromey, Lisa; Price, Lesley; Stewart, Sally; de Lacy, Elen; Norman, Chris; Linley, Ezra; Otter, Ashley D; Semper, Amanda; Hewson, Jacqueline; D'Arcangelo, Silvia; Chand, Meera; Brown, Colin S; Brooks, Tim; Islam, Jasmin; Charlett, Andre; Hopkins, Susan", "jour": "The New England journal of medicine", "affl": "From the U.K. Health Security Agency (V.H., S.F., F.I., P.K., A.

METHODS: We investigated the duration and effectiveness of immunity in a prospective cohort of asymptomatic health care workers in the United Kingdom who underwent routine polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing. Vaccine effectiveness (</=10 months after the first dose of vaccine) and infection-acquired immunity were assessed by comparing the time to PCR-confirmed infection in vaccinated persons with that in unvaccinated persons, stratified according to previous infection status. We used a Cox regression model with adjustment for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status, vaccine type and dosing interval, demographic characteristics, and workplace exposure to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 35,768 participants, 27% (9488) had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine coverage was high: 95% of the participants had received two doses (78% had received BNT162b2 vaccine [Pfizer-BioNTech] with a long interval between doses, 9% BNT162b2 vaccine with a short interval between doses, and 8% ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine [AstraZeneca]). Between December 7, 2020, and September 21, 2021, a total of 2747 primary infections and 210 reinfections were observed. Among previously uninfected participants who received long-interval BNT162b2 vaccine, adjusted vaccine effectiveness decreased from 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72 to 92) 14 to 73 days after the second dose to 51% (95% CI, 22 to 69) at a median of 201 days (interquartile range, 197 to 205) after the second dose; this effectiveness did not differ significantly between the long-interval and short-interval BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. At 14 to 73 days after the second dose, adjusted vaccine effectiveness among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients was 58% (95% CI, 23 to 77) - considerably lower than that among BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. Infection-acquired immunity waned after 1 year in unvaccinated participants but remained consistently higher than 90% in those who were subsequently vaccinated, even in persons infected more than 18 months previously. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine were associated with high short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection; this protection waned considerably after 6 months. Infection-acquired immunity boosted with vaccination remained high more than 1 year after infection.

Later, other heterologous combinations of CoronaVac (DB15806), Janssen (JNJ-78436735), CanSino (AD5-nCOV) and other were also being trialled to explore their effectiveness. Previously, such a strategy was deployed for HIV, Ebola virus, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza and hepatitis B to develop the artificial acquired active immunity. The present review explores the science behind such an approach for candidate COVID-19 vaccines developed using 11 different platforms approved by the World Health Organization. METHODS: The candidate vaccines' pharmaceutical parameters (e.g. platforms, number needed to vaccinate and intervals, adjuvanted status, excipients and preservatives added, efficacy and effectiveness, vaccine adverse events, and boosters), and clinical aspects must be analysed for the mix-and-match approach. Results prime-boost trials showed safety, effectiveness, higher systemic reactogenicity, well tolerability with improved immunogenicity, and flexibility profiles for future vaccinations, especially during acute and global shortages, compared to the homologous counterparts. CONCLUSION: Still, large controlled trials are warranted to address challenging variants of concerns including Omicron and other, and to generalize the effectiveness of the approach in regular as well as emergency use during vaccine scarcity.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34918097/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/6463576 https://sci-hub.do/taab191 https://sci-hub.do/10.1093/jtm/taab191", "pt": "Journal Article; Review", "pl": "England", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 34919640, "aid": "6468807 aqab210 10.1093/ajcp/aqab210", "titl": "COVID-19 and Immune-Mediated RBC Destruction.", "mesh": "2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; Aged;;; Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; Middle Aged;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Thrombocytopenia;;; *Vaccines;;; Vaccines, Synthetic;;; mRNA Vaccines", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Jacobs, Jeremy W; Booth, Garrett S", "jour": "American journal of clinical pathology", "affl": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.;;; Department of Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Jun 7", "tiab": "OBJECTIVES: To summarize the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using standardized keyword search to identify all reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and AIHA across PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar through September 24, 2021. RESULTS: Fifty patients (mean [SD] age, 50.8 [21.6] years) diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and AIHA were identified. AIHA subtypes and number of patients were as follows: cold AIHA (n = 18), warm AIHA (n = 14), mixed-type AIHA (n = 3), direct antiglobulin test (DAT)-negative AIHA (n = 1), DAT-negative Evans syndrome (n = 1), Evans syndrome (n = 3), and subtype not reported (n = 10). Mean (SD) hemoglobin at AIHA diagnosis was 6.5 [2.8] g/dL (95% confidence interval, 5.7-7.3 g/dL). Median time from COVID-19 symptom onset to AIHA diagnosis was 7 days. In total, 19% (8/42) of patients with COVID-19-associated AIHA with reported outcomes were deceased. Four patients (mean [SD] age, 73.5 [16.9] years) developed AIHA following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine (n = 2); Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine (n = 1); undisclosed mRNA vaccine (n = 1).

METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in the United States and Mexico during the first half of 2021 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in adults (>/=18 years of age) who had not had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart. The primary objective was to determine vaccine efficacy against reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed Covid-19 occurring at least 7 days after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease and against different variants was also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 29,949 participants who underwent randomization between December 27, 2020, and February 18, 2021, a total of 29,582 (median age, 47 years; 12.6% >/=65 years of age) received at least one dose: 19,714 received vaccine and 9868 placebo. Over a period of 3 months, 77 cases of Covid-19 were noted - 14 among vaccine recipients and 63 among placebo recipients (vaccine efficacy, 90.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 82.9 to 94.6; P<0.001). Ten moderate and 4 severe cases occurred, all in placebo recipients, yielding vaccine efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease of 100% (95% CI, 87.0 to 100). Most sequenced viral genomes (48 of 61, 79%) were variants of concern or interest - largely B.1.1.7 (alpha) (31 of the 35 genomes for variants of concern, 89%). Vaccine efficacy against any variant of concern or interest was 92.6% (95% CI, 83.6 to 96.7). Reactogenicity was mostly mild to moderate and transient but was more frequent among NVX-CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients and was more frequent after the second dose than after the first dose. CONCLUSIONS: NVX-CoV2373 was safe and effective for the prevention of Covid-19. Most breakthrough cases were caused by contemporary variant strains.

Although vaccination still lowers the risk of infection, similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who are infected with the delta variant call into question the degree to which vaccination prevents transmission. METHODS: We used contact-testing data from England to perform a retrospective observational cohort study involving adult contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected adult index patients. We used multivariable Poisson regression to investigate associations between transmission and the vaccination status of index patients and contacts and to determine how these associations varied with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and delta variants and time since the second vaccination. RESULTS: Among 146,243 tested contacts of 108,498 index patients, 54,667 (37%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests. In index patients who became infected with the alpha variant, two vaccinations with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (also known as AZD1222), as compared with no vaccination, were independently associated with reduced PCR positivity in contacts (adjusted rate ratio with BNT162b2, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.48; and with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.78). Vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the delta variant were smaller than those with the alpha variant, and reductions in transmission of the delta variant after two BNT162b2 vaccinations were greater (adjusted rate ratio for the comparison with no vaccination, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.65) than after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations (adjusted rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.82). Variation in cycle-threshold (Ct) values (indicative of viral load) in index patients explained 7 to 23% of vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the two variants. The reductions in transmission of the delta variant declined over time after the second vaccination, reaching levels that were similar to those in unvaccinated persons by 12 weeks in index patients who had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and attenuating substantially in those who had received BNT162b2. Protection in contacts also declined in the 3-month period after the second vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was associated with a smaller reduction in transmission of the delta variant than of the alpha variant, and the effects of vaccination decreased over time. PCR Ct values at diagnosis of the index patient only partially explained decreased transmission.

Beliefs regarding the causes of these symptoms may influence their perception and promote maladaptive health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of self-reported COVID-19 infection and SARS-CoV-2 serology test results with persistent physical symptoms (eg, fatigue, breathlessness, or impaired attention) in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants in this cross-sectional analysis were 26\u202f823 individuals from the French population-based CONSTANCES cohort, included between 2012 and 2019, who took part in the nested SAPRIS and SAPRIS-SERO surveys. Between May and November 2020, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Between December 2020 and January 2021, the participants reported whether they believed they had experienced COVID-19 infection and had physical symptoms during the previous 4 weeks that had persisted for at least 8 weeks. Participants who reported having an initial COVID-19 infection only after completing the serology test were excluded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Logistic regressions for each persistent symptom as the outcome were computed in models including both self-reported COVID-19 infection and serology test results and adjusting for age, sex, income, and educational level. RESULTS: Of 35\u202f852 volunteers invited to participate in the study, 26\u202f823 (74.8%) with complete data were included in the present study (mean [SD] age, 49.4 [12.9] years; 13\u202f731 women [51.2%]). Self-reported infection was positively associated with persistent physical symptoms, with odds ratios ranging from 1.39 (95% CI, 1.03-1.86) to 16.37 (95% CI, 10.21-26.24) except for hearing impairment (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.82-2.55) and sleep problems (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.89-1.46). A serology test result positive for SARS-COV-2 was positively associated only with persistent anosmia (odds ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.66-4.46), even when restricting the analyses to participants who attributed their symptoms to COVID-19 infection. Further adjusting for self-rated health or depressive symptoms yielded similar results. There was no significant interaction between belief and serology test results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cross-sectional analysis of a large, population-based French cohort suggest that persistent physical symptoms after COVID-19 infection may be associated more with the belief in having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than with having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Further research in this area should consider underlying mechanisms that may not be specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Worldwide, millions of people are at risk due to the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). Despite the lack of clinically authorized antiviral medications and vaccines for COVID-19, clinical trials of many recognized antiviral agents, their combination, and vaccine development in patients with confirmed COVID-19 are still ongoing. This discovery gave us a chance to get immune to this disease worldwide and end the pandemic. However, the unexpected capacity of mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus makes it difficult, like the recent SAS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Therefore, there is a great necessity to spread the vaccination programs and prevent the spread of this dreadful epidemic by identifying and isolating afflicted patients.

For these purposes, use of the quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for detection of the viral nucleic acid remains the most valuable in terms of its specificity, fast turn-around, high-throughput capacity, and reliability. It is critical to update the sequences of primers and probes to ensure the detection of newly emerged variants. Various assays for increased levels of IgG or IgM antibodies are available for detecting ongoing or past infection, vaccination responses, and persistence and for identifying high titers of neutralizing antibodies in recovered individuals. Viral genome sequencing is increasingly used for tracing infectious sources, monitoring mutations, and subtype classification and is less valuable in diagnosis because of its capacity and high cost. Nanopore target sequencing with portable options is available for a quick process for sequencing data. Emerging CRISPR-Cas-based assays, such as SHERLOCK and AIOD-CRISPR, for viral genome detection may offer options for prompt and point-of-care detection. Moreover, aptamer-based probes may be multifaceted for developing portable and high-throughput assays with fluorescent or chemiluminescent probes for viral proteins.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir reduces risk for hospitalization or death among outpatients with early COVID-19 in the setting of prevalent SARS-CoV-2 immunity and immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 lineages. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study analyzed to emulate a clinical trial using inverse probability-weighted models to account for anticipated bias in treatment. SETTING: A large health care system providing care for 1.5 million patients in Massachusetts and New Hampshire during the Omicron wave (1 January to 17 July 2022). PATIENTS: 44 551 nonhospitalized adults (90.3% with >/=3 vaccine doses) aged 50 years or older with COVID-19 and no contraindications for nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalization within 14 days or death within 28 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: During the study period, 12 541 (28.1%) patients were prescribed nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir, and 32 010 (71.9%) were not. Patients prescribed nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir were more likely to be older, have more comorbidities, and be vaccinated. The composite outcome of hospitalization or death occurred in 69 (0.55%) patients who were prescribed nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir and 310 (0.97%) who were not (adjusted risk ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.75]). Recipients of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir had lower risk for hospitalization (adjusted risk ratio, 0.60 [CI, 0.44 to 0.81]) and death (adjusted risk ratio, 0.29 [CI, 0.12 to 0.71]). LIMITATION: Potential residual confounding due to differential access to COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostic tests, and treatment. CONCLUSION: The overall risk for hospitalization or death was already low (1%) after an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, but nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir reduced this risk further.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of symptomatic infection with prior vaccination with BNT162b2 to estimate VE among children and adolescents during Omicron variant predominance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A test-negative, case-control analysis was conducted using data from 6897 pharmacy-based, drive-through SARS-CoV-2 testing sites across the US from a single pharmacy chain in the Increasing Community Access to Testing platform. This analysis included 74\u202f208 tests from children 5 to 11 years of age and 47\u202f744 tests from adolescents 12 to 15 years of age with COVID-19-like illness who underwent SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing from December 26, 2021, to February 21, 2022. EXPOSURES: Two BNT162b2 doses 2 weeks or more before SARS-CoV-2 testing vs no vaccination for children; 2 or 3 doses 2 weeks or more before testing vs no vaccination for adolescents (who are recommended to receive a booster dose). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Symptomatic infection. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association of prior vaccination and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was used to estimate VE: VE = (1 - OR) x 100%. RESULTS: A total of 30\u202f999 test-positive cases and 43\u202f209 test-negative controls were included from children 5 to 11 years of age, as well as 22\u202f273 test-positive cases and 25\u202f471 test-negative controls from adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. The median age among those with included tests was 10 years (IQR, 7-13); 61\u202f189 (50.2%) were female, 75\u202f758 (70.1%) were White, and 29\u202f034 (25.7%) were Hispanic/Latino. At 2 to 4 weeks after dose 2, among children, the adjusted OR was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.35-0.45; estimated VE, 60.1% [95% CI, 54.7%-64.8%]) and among adolescents, the OR was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.29-0.56; estimated VE, 59.5% [95% CI, 44.3%-70.6%]). During month 2 after dose 2, among children, the OR was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67-0.76; estimated VE, 28.9% [95% CI, 24.5%-33.1%]) and among adolescents, the OR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.92; estimated VE, 16.6% [95% CI, 8.1%-24.3%]).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on AIH patients with COVID-19. The outcomes of AIH patients who had acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) breakthrough infection after at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine were compared to unvaccinated patients with AIH. COVID-19 outcome was classified according to clinical state during the disease course as: (i) no hospitalization, (ii) hospitalization without oxygen supplementation, (iii) hospitalization with oxygen supplementation by nasal cannula or mask, (iv) intensive care unit (ICU) admission with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, (v) ICU admission with invasive mechanical ventilation or (vi) death, and data was analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: We included 413 (258 unvaccinated and 155 vaccinated) patients (81%, female) with a median age of 52 (range: 17-85) years at COVID-19 diagnosis. The rates of hospitalization were (36.4% vs. 14.2%), need for any supplemental oxygen (29.5% vs. 9%) and mortality (7% vs. 0.6%) in unvaccinated and vaccinated AIH patients with COVID-19. Having received at least one dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was associated with a significantly lower risk of worse COVID-19 severity, after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and presence of cirrhosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.31). Overall, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality from COVID-19 (aOR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.35).

It is critically important to understand the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of COVID-19 vaccines among IC populations as recommendations are updated over time in response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. AREAS COVERED: A targeted literature review was conducted to identify real-world studies that assessed COVID-19 VE in IC populations between December 2020 and September 2021. A total of 10 studies from four countries were identified and summarized in this review. EXPERT OPINION: VE of the widely available COVID-19 vaccines, including BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen), and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), ranged from 64% to 90% against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73% to 84% against symptomatic illness, 70% to 100% against severe illness, and 63% to 100% against COVID-19-related hospitalization among the fully vaccinated IC populations included in the studies. COVID-19 VE for most outcomes in the IC populations included in these studies were lower than in the general populations.

The current gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 is the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which is a sensitive and specific method to detect SARS-CoV-2. Other RNA-based methods include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), droplet digital reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (ddRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The serological testing of antibodies (IgM and IgG), nanoparticle-based lateral-flow assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used to enhance the detection sensitivity and accuracy. Because antibodies are usually detected a week after the onset of symptoms, these tests are used to assess the overall infection rate in the community. Sine the fact that healthcare varies from country to country across the world, different types of diagnosing COVID-19 imaging technologies including chest computed tomography (CT), chest radiography, and lung ultrasound are used in different degrees. Besides, the pooling test is an important public health tool to reduce cost and increase testing capacity in low-risk area, while artificial intelligence (AI) may aid to increase the diagnostic efficiency of imaging-based methods.

In this study, we report results on the final efficacy and interim safety analyses of the phase 3 trial. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, international, placebo-controlled, endpoint-case driven, phase 3, clinical trial enrolled adults aged 18 years older at study centres in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Pakistan, and Russia. Participants were eligible for the study if they had no unstable or severe underlying medical or psychiatric conditions; had no history of a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; were not pregnant or breastfeeding; and had no previous receipt of an adenovirus-vectored, coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. After informed consent was obtained, 25 mL of whole blood was withdrawn from all eligible participants who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular dose of 0.5 mL placebo or a 0.5 mL dose of 5 x 10(10) viral particle (vp)/mL Ad5-nCoV vaccine; study staff and participants were blinded to treatment allocation. All participants were contacted weekly by email, telephone, or text message to self-report any symptoms of COVID-19 illness, and laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done for all participants with any symptoms. The primary efficacy objective evaluated Ad5-nCoV in preventing symptomatic, PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection occurring at least 28 days after vaccination in all participants who were at least 28 days postvaccination on Jan 15, 2021. The primary safety objective evaluated the incidence of any serious adverse events or medically attended adverse events postvaccination in all participants who received a study injection. This trial is closed for enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04526990). FINDINGS: Study enrolment began on Sept 22, 2020, in Pakistan, Nov 6, 2020, in Mexico, Dec 2, 2020, in Russia and Chile, and Dec 17, 2020, in Argentina; 150 endpoint cases were reached on Jan 15, 2021, triggering the final primary efficacy analysis. One dose of Ad5-nCoV showed a 57.5% (95% CI 39.7-70.0, p=0.0026) efficacy against symptomatic, PCR-confirmed, COVID-19 infection at 28 days or more postvaccination (21 250 participants; 45 days median duration of follow-up [IQR 36-58]). In the primary safety analysis undertaken at the time of the efficacy analysis (36 717 participants), there was no significant difference in the incidence of serious adverse events (14 [0.1%] of 18 363 Ad5-nCoV recipients and 10 [0.1%] of 18 354 placebo recipients, p=0.54) or medically attended adverse events (442 [2.4%] of 18 363 Ad5-nCoV recipients and 411 [2.2%] of 18 354 placebo recipients, p=0.30) between the Ad5-nCoV or placebo groups, or any serious adverse events considered related to the study product (none in both Ad5-nCoV and placebo recipients). In the extended safety cohort, 1004 (63.5%) of 1582 of Ad5-nCoV recipients and 729 (46.4%) of 1572 placebo recipients reported a solicited systemic adverse event (p<0.0001), of which headache was the most common (699 [44%] of Ad5-nCoV recipients and 481 [30.6%] of placebo recipients; p<0.0001). 971 (61.3%) of 1584 Ad5-nCoV recipients and 314 (20.0%) of 1573 placebo recipients reported an injection-site adverse event (p<0.0001), of which pain at the injection site was the most frequent; reported by 939 (59%) Ad5-nCoV recipients and 303 (19%) placebo recipients.

We included observational studies that collected samples from respiratory tract to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR, reporting the number of false-negative subjects and the number of final patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Reported rates of false negatives were pooled in a meta-analysis as appropriate. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies and graded the quality of evidence according to the GRADE method. All information in this article is current up to February 2021. RESULTS: We included 32 studies, enrolling more than 18,000 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. The overall false-negative rate was 0.12 (95%CI from 0.10 to 0.14) with very low certainty of evidence. The impact of misdiagnoses was estimated according to disease prevalence; a range between 2 and 58/1,000 subjects could be misdiagnosed with a disease prevalence of 10%, increasing to 290/1,000 misdiagnosed subjects with a disease prevalence of 50%. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed that up to 58% of COVID-19 patients may have initial false-negative RT-PCR results, suggesting the need to implement a correct diagnostic strategy to correctly identify suspected cases, thereby reducing false-negative results and decreasing the disease burden among the population.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34741305/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/ECI13706 https://sci-hub.do/10.1111/eci.13706", "pt": "Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Review", "pl": "England", "topic": 1, "prop": 0.8575856276964758}, {"uid": 36730051, "aid": "mm7205e1 10.15585/mmwr.mm7205e1", "titl": "Early Estimates of Bivalent mRNA Booster Dose Vaccine Effectiveness in Preventing Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection Attributable to Omicron BA.5- and XBB/XBB.1.5-Related Sublineages Among Immunocompetent Adults - Increasing Community Access to Testing Program, United States, December 2022-January 2023.", "mesh": "Adult;;; United States/epidemiology;;; Humans;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; Vaccines, Combined;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Vaccine Efficacy;;; RNA, Messenger", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Link-Gelles, Ruth; Ciesla, Allison Avrich; Roper, Lauren E; Scobie, Heather M; Ali, Akilah R; Miller, Joseph D; Wiegand, Ryan E; Accorsi, Emma K; Verani, Jennifer R; Shang, Nong; Derado, Gordana; Britton, Amadea; Smith, Zachary R; Fleming-Dutra, Katherine E", "jour": "MMWR.

COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary by SARS-CoV-2 variant; reduced VE has been observed against some variants, although this is dependent on the health outcome of interest. The goal of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program is to prevent severe disease, including hospitalization and death (1); however, VE against symptomatic infection can provide useful insight into vaccine protection against emerging variants in advance of VE estimates against more severe disease. Data from the Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) national pharmacy program for SARS-CoV-2 testing were analyzed to estimate VE of updated (bivalent) mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection caused by BA.5-related and XBB/XBB.1.5-related sublineages among immunocompetent adults during December 1, 2022-January 13, 2023. Reduction or failure of spike gene (S-gene) amplification (SGTF) in real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a proxy indicator of infection with likely BA.5-related sublineages and S-gene target presence (SGTP) of infection with likely XBB/XBB.1.5-related sublineages (2). Among 29,175 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) with SGTF or SGTP results available from adults who had previously received 2-4 monovalent COVID-19 vaccine doses, the relative VE of a bivalent booster dose given 2-3 months earlier compared with no bivalent booster in persons aged 18-49 years was 52% against symptomatic BA.5 infection and 48% against symptomatic XBB/XBB.1.5 infection. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, continued vaccine effectiveness monitoring is important. Bivalent vaccines appear to provide additional protection against symptomatic BA.5-related sublineage and XBB/XBB.1.5-related sublineage infections in persons who had previously received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses.

Considering the interconnection between infections and male infertility, investigation of the potential impact of COVID-19 on men's reproductive health is now a particularly relevant topic. Published data indicate decreased sperm quality and orchitis development in patients with COVID-19, including reduced sperm count, decreased sperm motility, and elevated DNA fragmentation index. Although mass vaccination against COVID-19 is currently being carried out worldwide using available authorized vaccines, the effect of these vaccines on men's reproductive health has not yet been investigated. There is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in semen, but available data suggest that it can infect spermatogonia, spermatids, Leydig cells, and Sertoli cells. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 orchitis and reduced male fertility may be long-term complications of COVID-19, which requires further investigation. Currently, there is also no evidence that vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have any pathological effects on spermatogenesis or male reproductive health. Thus, further studies are needed to determine the effects of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines on men's reproductive health, which will help to optimize the management and rehabilitation of these patients. This review aims to discuss recent studies on the impact of the COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines on men's reproductive health.

DESIGN: Living systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Major databases between 1 December 2019 and 3 August 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies of pregnant and recently pregnant women (including after abortion or miscarriage) who sought hospital care for any reason and had a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also provided data on offspring SARS-CoV-2 status and risk factors for positivity. Case series and case reports were also included to assess the timing and likelihood of mother-to-child transmission in SARS-CoV-2 positive babies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. A random effects model was used to synthesise data for rates, with associations reported using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Narrative syntheses were performed when meta-analysis was inappropriate. The World Health Organization classification was used to categorise the timing of mother-to-child transmission (in utero, intrapartum, early postnatal). RESULTS: 472 studies (206 cohort studies, 266 case series and case reports; 28 952 mothers, 18 237 babies) were included. Overall, 1.8% (95% confidence interval 1.2% to 2.5%; 140 studies) of the 14 271 babies born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection tested positive for the virus with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of the 592 SARS-CoV-2 positive babies with data on the timing of exposure and type and timing of tests, 14 had confirmed mother-to-child transmission: seven in utero (448 assessed), two intrapartum (18 assessed), and five during the early postnatal period (70 assessed). Of the 800 SARS-CoV-2 positive babies with outcome data, 20 were stillbirths, 23 were neonatal deaths, and eight were early pregnancy losses; 749 babies were alive at the end of follow-up. Severe maternal covid-19 (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.4), maternal death (14.1, 4.1 to 48.0), maternal admission to an intensive care unit (3.5, 1.7 to 6.9), and maternal postnatal infection (5.0, 1.2 to 20.1) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in offspring. Positivity rates using RT-PCR varied between regions, ranging from 0.1% (95% confidence interval 0.0% to 0.3%) in studies from North America to 5.7% (3.2% to 8.7%) in studies from Latin America and the Caribbean. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates were found to be low in babies born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence suggests confirmed vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although this is likely to be rare. Severity of maternal covid-19 appears to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in offspring.

The underlying prospective, diagnostic case-control-type accuracy study included 87 hospitalized and nonhospitalized participants in a positive and a negative sample cohort between 16 March and 14 May 2021 in two hospitals in Vienna. SARS-CoV-2 infection status was confirmed by RT-PCR. Participants self-performed one oral and one anterior nasal swab for the rapid antigen test, immediately followed by two nasopharyngeal swabs for the rapid antigen test and RT-PCR by the investigator. Test results were read after 15 min, and participants completed a questionnaire in the meantime. Test parameters were calculated based on the evaluation of 87 participants. The overall sensitivity of rapid antigen detection tests versus that of RT-PCR with oral, anterior nasal, and nasopharyngeal samples was 18.18% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.19% to 32.71%), 63.04% (95% CI 47.55% to 76.79%), and 73.33% (95% CI 58.06% to 85.4%), respectively. All sampling methods had a test specificity of 100% regardless of the cycle threshold (C(T)) value. Rapid antigen detection tests using self-collected anterior nasal swabs proved to be as sensitive as and more tolerable than professionally collected nasopharyngeal swabs for C(T) values up to 30 determined by RT-PCR. This finding illustrates the reliability of tests obtained by adequate self-collected anterior nasal specimen. Sensitivity was dependent upon the C(T) value for each sampling method. While the main advantage of rapid antigen detection tests is the immediate availability of results, PCR should be preferred in crucial settings wherever possible. IMPORTANCE Rapid antigen detection devices for SARS-CoV-2 represent a valuable tool for monitoring the spread of infection. However, the reliability of the tests depends largely on the test performance and the respective sampling method. Nasopharyngeal swabs mark the gold standard for sample collection in suspected respiratory tract infections but are unsuitable for widespread application, as they must be performed by medically trained personnel. With the underlying study, the head-to-head test performance and the usability of self-collected samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection using rapid antigen detection devices were evaluated. The results confirm similar sensitivity of self-collected anterior nasal swabs to that of professionally collected nasopharyngeal swabs for patients with a C(T) of < 30 determined by RT-PCR.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35107327/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/02029-21 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.02029-21 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.02029-21", "pt": "Evaluation Study; Journal Article", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 34922126, "aid": "S0165-5728(21)00312-X 577785 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2021.577785", "titl": "New diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in the setting of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine exposure.", "mesh": "*2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; Adult;;; *BNT162 Vaccine;;; COVID-19/*prevention & control;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Male;;; Middle Aged;;; Multiple Sclerosis/*epidemiology;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Toljan, Karlo; Amin, Moein; Kunchok, Amy; Ontaneda, Daniel", "jour": "Journal of neuroimmunology", "affl": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States.;;; Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States.;;; Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States.;;; Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States.

Globally, there have been millions of infections and fatalities. Unfortunately, the virus has been persistent and a contributing factor is the emergence of several variants. The urgency to combat COVID-19 led to the identification/development of various diagnosis (polymerase chain reaction and antigen tests) and treatment (repurposed drugs, convalescent plasma, antibodies and vaccines) options. These treatments may treat mild symptoms and decrease the risk of life-threatening disease. Although these options have been fairly beneficial, there are some challenges and limitations, such as cost of tests/drugs, specificity, large treatment dosages, intravenous administration, need for trained personal, lengthy production time, high manufacturing costs, and limited availability. Therefore, the development of more efficient COVID-19 diagnostic and therapeutic options are vital. Nanobodies (Nbs) are novel monomeric antigen-binding fragments derived from camelid antibodies. Advantages of Nbs include low immunogenicity, high specificity, stability and affinity. These characteristics allow for rapid Nb generation, inexpensive large-scale production, effective storage, and transportation, which is essential during pandemics. Additionally, the potential aerosolization and inhalation delivery of Nbs allows for targeted treatment delivery as well as patient self-administration. Therefore, Nbs are a viable option to target SARS-CoV-2 and overcome COVID-19.

The disease was initially called nCoV-2019 or SARS-nCoV-2 and later termed as COVID-19 by WHO. The infection is rapidly propagating from the day of emergence, spread throughout the globe and now became a pandemic which challenged the competencies of developed nations in terms of health care management.

COVID-19 vaccination strategies have been implemented worldwide, and repeat COVID-19 outbreaks have been seen. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the reduction of perceived anxiety and the association between public anxiety and antibody testing intention during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Chinese adults aged 18 and over were surveyed using an anonymous online questionnaire in April and May 2021. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination characteristics, perceived anxiety due to COVID-19, and attitudes toward future antibody testing after COVID-19 vaccination. Perceived anxiety was assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors influencing future antibody detection. RESULTS: A total of 3,233 people were investigated, 3,209 valid questionnaires were collected, and the response rate was 99.3%. Of the 3,209 respondents, 2,047 were vaccinated, and 1,162 were unvaccinated. There was a significant difference in anxiety levels between vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents (24.9+/-25.4 vs. 50.0+/-33.1, respectively). With the local spread of COVID-19 in mainland China, the public anxiety VAS scores increased by 15.4+/-25.6 (SMD=120%) and 33.8+/-31.7 (SMD=49%) among vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents, respectively. Of the 2,047 respondents who were vaccinated, 1,626 (79.4%) thought they would accept antibody testing. Those who displayed more anxiety about acquiring COVID-19 disease were more likely to accept COVID-19 antibody testing. If the antibody test results showed protective antibodies, 1,190 (58.1%) were more likely to arrange travel plans in China, while 526 (25.7%) thought they would feel safer traveling abroad. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination strategies help reduce public anxiety. However, public anxiety may be elevated as the local transmission of COVID-19 occurs in mainland China, which is usually caused now by imported cases. Those who display more anxiety choose to have antibody testing. Improving the accessibility of COVID-19 antibody tests can help ease public anxiety and enhance the confidence of some people to participate in social activities.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35602124/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fpubh.2022.819062", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36511275, "aid": "S0027-9684(22)00144-4 10.1016/j.jnma.2022.08.003", "titl": "Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273) COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and hypersensitivity reactions.", "mesh": "Humans;;; 2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;;; *Hypersensitivity/etiology;;; mRNA Vaccines;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Haq, Hannah N; Khan, Hafiz; Chaudhry, Haroon; Nimmala, Swathi; Demidovich, Joseph; Papudesi, Bhavani Nagendra; Potluri, Sai Deepika", "jour": "Journal of the National Medical Association", "affl": "Department of Medicine, All Saints University, School of Medicine, Roseau, Dominica.

METHODS: We describe how ICES, an independent not-for-profit research and analytic institute in Ontario, Canada, pivoted existing research infrastructure and engaged health system stakeholders to provide near real-time population-based data and analytics to support Ontario's COVID-19 pandemic response. RESULTS: Since April 2020, ICES provided the Ontario COVID-19 Provincial Command Table and public health partners with regular and ad hoc reports on SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 vaccine coverage. These reports: 1) helped identify congregate care/shared living settings that needed testing and prevention efforts early in the pandemic; 2) provided early indications of inequities in testing and infection in marginalized neighbourhoods, including areas with higher proportions of immigrants and visible minorities; 3) identified areas with high test positivity, which helped Public Health Units target and evaluate prevention efforts; and 4) contributed to altering the province's COVID-19 vaccine roll-out strategy to target high-risk neighbourhoods and helping Public Health Units and community organizations plan local vaccination programs. In addition, ICES is a key component of the Ontario Health Data Platform, which provides scientists with data access to conduct COVID-19 research and analyses.

One such pandemic strain of coronavirus was recently identified in December 2019, and it led to a devastating outbreak in Wuhan city of China. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2). It is highly contagious and causes symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to highlight the current understanding, research, and therapeutic updates of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted for research papers and patents in the context of COVID-19. All the related articles were extracted from various public repositories such as Google Scholar, Pubmed, ScienceDirect (Elsevier), Springer, Web of Science, etc. Results: The present analysis revealed that the key areas of the inventions were vaccines and diagnostic kits apart from developing the treatment of CoV. It was also observed that no specific vaccine treatments were available for the treatment of 2019-nCov; therefore, developing novel chemical or biological drugs and kits for early diagnosis, prevention, and disease management is the primary governing topic among the patented inventions. The present study also indicates potential research opportunities for the future, particularly to combat 2019-nCoV. The current focus of the researches has turned towards developing four potential treatments, including the development of candidate vaccines, development of novel potential drugs, repurposing of existing drugs, and development of convalescent plasma therapy. The PCR based diagnosis is the gold standard for the COVID-19 testing, but it requires resource time, expertise, and high associated cost; hence researchers are also developing different diagnostic methods for the COVID-19. Although vaccines are being developed by various companies and have passed the pre-clinical stages but there still exists no guarantee for these to come into effect. The current treatments that are being used for COVID-19 patients are not well established and have shown limited success. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has challenged the medical, economic, and public health infrastructure across the globe.

Little is known about COVID-19 testing and vaccination acceptability among homeless-experienced populations. OBJECTIVE: To understand the facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccine acceptability among homeless-experienced adults. DESIGN: We conducted in-depth interviews with participants from July to October 2020. We purposively recruited participants from (1) a longitudinal cohort of homeless-experienced older adults in Oakland, CA (n=37) and (2) a convenience sample of people (n=57) during a mobile outreach COVID-19 testing event in San Francisco. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with current or past experience of homelessness. APPROACH: We asked participants about their experiences with and attitudes towards COVID-19 testing and their perceptions of COVID-19 vaccinations. We used participant observation techniques to document the interactions between testing teams and those approached for testing. We audio-recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed all interviews and identified major themes and subthemes. KEY RESULTS: Participants found incentivized COVID-19 testing administered in unsheltered settings and supported by community health outreach workers (CHOWs) to be acceptable. The majority of participants expressed a positive inclination toward vaccine acceptability, citing a desire to return to routine life and civic responsibility. Those who expressed hesitancy cited a desire to see trial data, concerns that vaccines included infectious materials, and mistrust of the government. CONCLUSIONS: Participants expressed positive evaluations of the incentivized, mobile COVID-19 testing supported by CHOWs in unsheltered settings. The majority of participants expressed a positive inclination toward vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy concerns must be addressed when designing vaccine delivery strategies that overcome access challenges.

These issues were acutely felt in New Zealand, an island nation located at the end of most supply lines.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe characteristics of patients with chronic respiratory disease (CRD) experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, who were seen in a novel Acute Respiratory Clinic, prior to widely available testing, emergence of variants, COVID-19 vaccination, and post-vaccination (breakthrough) SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: Retrospective electronic medical record data were analyzed from 907 adults with presumed COVID-19 seen between March 16, 2020 and January 7, 2021. Data included demographics, comorbidities, medications, vital signs, laboratory tests, pulmonary function tests, patient disposition, and co-infections. The overdispersed data (aod) R package was used to create a logit model using COVID-19 diagnosis by PCR as the dichotomous outcome variable. Univariate, conventional multivariate and elastic net machine learning were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Male gender, elevated baseline temperature, and respiratory rate predicted COVID-19 diagnosis. Eosinopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphocytosis were also associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. However, asthma and COPD diagnoses were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive test. Male gender, low oxygen saturation, and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) were associated with higher hospital referral. CONCLUSIONS: CRD patients with acute respiratory symptoms in the ambulatory setting were more likely to have COVID-19 if male, febrile and tachypneic. Patients with lower pre-morbid FEV(1) and lower SPO(2) are more likely to be referred to the hospital.

In addition, the detection flux of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is small, and the whole detection process takes much time, which cannot meet the actual needs of rapid screening in large quantities. The WHO conditionally approved a batch of SARS-CoV-2 antigen reagents for clinical application to alleviate this contradiction. SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection offers a trade-off among clinical performance, speed and accessibility. With the gradual increase in clinical application, the accumulated clinical data show that the sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay are over 80% and 97%, respectively, which can basically meet the requirements of the WHO. However, the sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay among asymptomatic people in low prevalence areas of COVID-19 cannot meet the standard, leading to a large number of missed diagnoses. In addition, the detection ability of SARS-CoV-2 antigen reagent for different SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains differs greatly, especially for those escaping the COVID-19 vaccines. In terms of results interpretation, it is highly reliable to exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the high negative predictive value of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay. However, in the low prevalence environment, the probability of false positives of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay is high, so the positive results need to be confirmed by the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid reagent.

The emergence and spread of variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 has altered the disease transmission dynamics, thus creating a need for continuously monitoring the real-world effectiveness of various vaccines and assessing their overall impact on disease control. To achieve this goal, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) along with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, took the lead to develop the India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker by synergizing three different public health databases: National COVID-19 testing database, CoWIN vaccination database and the COVID-19 India portal. A Vaccine Data Analytics Committee (VDAC) was constituted to advise on various modalities of the proposed tracker. The VDAC reviewed the data related to COVID-19 testing, vaccination and patient outcomes available in the three databases and selected relevant data points for inclusion in the tracker, following which databases were integrated, using common identifiers, wherever feasible. Multiple data filters were applied to retrieve information of all individuals >/=18 yr who died after the acquisition of COVID-19 infection with or without vaccination, irrespective of the time between vaccination and test positivity. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the reduction of mortality and hospitalizations was initially assessed. As compared to the hospitalization data, mortality reporting was found to be much better in terms of correctness and completeness. Therefore, hospitalization data were not considered for analysis and presentation in the vaccine tracker. The vaccine tracker thus depicts VE against mortality, calculated by a cohort approach using person-time analysis. Incidence of COVID-19 deaths among one- and two-dose vaccine recipients was compared with that among unvaccinated groups, to estimate the rate ratios (RRs). VE was estimated as 96.6 and 97.5 per cent, with one and two doses of the vaccines, respectively, during the period of reporting. The India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker was officially launched on September 9, 2021. The high VE against mortality, as demonstrated by the tracker, has helped aid in allaying vaccine hesitancy, augmenting and maintaining the momentum of India's COVID-19 vaccination drive.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35859397/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/351473 https://sci-hub.do/IJMR-155-513 https://sci-hub.do/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_3500_21", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "India", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36934395, "aid": "10.1002/cbin.12014", "titl": "Exosomes in COVID-19 infection: Focus on role in diagnosis, pathogenesis, immunity, and clinical trials.", "mesh": "Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19;;; *Exosomes;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Serotherapy", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Aljuhani, Alhanouf; Albalawi, Omniah; Albalawi, Rahaf; Alsalama, Reem; Alatawi, Safyah; Altemani, Reem; Abdel-Maksoud, Mohamed S; Elsherbiny, Nehal", "jour": "Cell biology international", "affl": "Pharm D Program, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.;;; Pharm D Program, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.;;; Pharm D Program, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.;;; Pharm D Program, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.;;; Pharm D Program, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.;;; Pharm D Program, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.", "pdat": "2023 Jun", "tiab": "Since the end of 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread as a new strain of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and progressed as a global pandemic. Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles released from almost all cells and are crucially involved in cell-cell communication. Interestingly, COVID-19 viral particles produce exosomes that moderate communication between infected and uninfected cells. Hence, there is growing evidence highlighting the crucial implications of exosomes in COVID-19 infection, transmission, intercellular spread, and reinfection. On the other hand, clinical trials have demonstrated mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as a promising therapeutic strategy for severely affected COVID-19 patients. Also, convalescent plasma-derived exosomes have been proposed for multiple efficacies in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, messenger RNAs (mRNA)-loaded exosomes were superior to mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles as a delivery system. Hence, exosomes can be used to safely induce SARS-CoV-2 immunity via their loading with mRNAs encoding immunogenic forms of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Moreover, exosomes can be used as a nano-delivery system for microRNA to alleviate cytokine storm and prevent the progression of organ failure in COVID-19 patients. The present review summarizes state of the art concerning the role of exosomes in COVID-19 infection and accompanying organ complications as well as the potential use of exosomes in COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, drug delivery, and vaccination.

The most reported symptoms were fatigue, headaches, and myalgia. Still, some subjects presented positive results for IgA after 130 days. Based on a temporal analysis, we have not identified general patterns as subjects presented high and low values of IgA and IgG with different evolution trends. Unexpectedly, for subjects with both serological tests, the outcome of IgA and IgG tests were the same (either positive or negative) for more than 80% of the samples.

Combination assays of SuperFlex (SuperFlex_any) and iFlash (iFlash_any) were also evaluated. METHODS: A total of 438 residual serum samples from 54 COVID-19 patients in the COVID-19 group and 100 samples from individuals without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the negative control group were evaluated. RESULTS: In the early stage of COVID-19 infection, within 14 days of symptom onset, the seropositive rate was lower than that of the late stage 15 days after onset (65.4% vs 99.6%). In the total period, the pan-Ig and IgG assays had higher sensitivity (90.8-95.3%) than the IgM assays (36.5-40.7%). SuperFlex_Ab and SuperFlex_any had higher sensitivity than Elecsys and SuperFlex_IgG (p < 0.05). The specificity of all the assays was 100%, except for SuperFlex_IgM (99.0%). The concordance rate between each assay was higher (96.4-100%) in the late stage than in the early stage (77.4-98.1%). CONCLUSION: For the purpose of COVID-19 diagnosis, antibody testing should be performed 15 days after onset. For the purpose of epidemiological surveillance, highly sensitive assays should be used as much as possible, such as SuperFlex_Ab, iFlash_IgG and their combination.

In particular, the recent emergence of Delta and Omicron variants, which are rapidly spreading worldwide, may bring many challenges to the medical systems. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine used to prevent tuberculosis can induce non-specific trained immunity, protecting against infectious diseases caused by respiratory viruses. Therefore, there is a hypothesis that BCG plays an essential role in reducing the incidence, severity, hospitalization, and mortality of COVID-19 and enhancing the protection efficiency of the COVID-19 vaccine. To confirm this hypothesis, 56 clinical trials have been conducted globally to assess BCG's protective effectiveness against COVID-19 infection.

We performed an inverse-variance meta-analysis of population-level effectiveness from public health reports in > 40 million individuals. RESULTS: A single dose of either mRNA vaccine yielded comparable antibody and neutralization titers to convalescent individuals. Ad26.COV2.S yielded lower antibody concentrations and frequently undetectable neutralization titers. Bulk and cytotoxic T-cell responses were higher in mRNA1273 and BNT162b2 than Ad26.COV2.S recipients. Regardless of vaccine, <50% of vaccinees demonstrated CD8+ T-cell responses. Antibody concentrations and neutralization titers increased comparably after the first dose of either vaccine, and further in recipients of a second dose. Prior infection was associated with high antibody concentrations and neutralization even after a single dose and regardless of vaccine. Neutralization of Beta, Gamma, and Delta strains were poorer regardless of vaccine. In meta-analysis, relative to mRNA1273 the effectiveness of BNT162b2 was lower against infection and hospitalization, and Ad26COV2.S was lower against infection, hospitalization, and death.

METHODS: The National Surveillance System with the National Immunization Registry were linked to form a large-linked database for assessment. Age-adjusted incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe disease, and death by vaccination status are calculated. Weekly vaccine effectiveness was calculated based on incidence rate ratio (IRR) between fully-vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, as: IRR = incidence rate of vaccinated / incidence rate of unvaccinated. We estimate the cumulative SARS-CoV-2 outcome overtime comparing the observed case with predicted cases without vaccination. RESULTS: Age-adjusted incidence in unvaccinated persons (5.69 per 100,000 person-day) was 2.7 times the rate in fully vaccinated (2.13 per 100,000 person-day) persons, resulting effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of 63%. Vaccine effectiveness against severe disease and death were 93% and 95%, respectively. Between March and October 2021, estimated Covid-19 related outcomes averted by vaccinations were: 46,508 infections, 3,424 severe diseases, and 718 deaths.

Positive and negative results, as determined by the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Veritor), were obtained for all individuals, with reflex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing performed on a case-by-case basis, per standard of care.

Access to rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detection self-testing kits may help improve the detection of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases and increase the country's low rate of SARS-CoV-2 testing. Before implementing self-testing in Nigeria, assessing the population's perceptions regarding this approach is imperative. In mid-2021, an exploratory cross-sectional qualitative research was conducted to investigate stakeholders' values and preferences for SARS-CoV-2 self-testing in Nigeria. METHODS: In-person and online semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with healthcare workers, representatives of civil society, and potential implementors of self-testing delivery programs were used to explore values and perceptions around access to conventional provider-initiated COVID-19 testing. Topics included the public's values in relation to SARS-CoV-2 self-testing, the safe and effective use of SARS-CoV-2 self-testing, and likely actions upon receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 self-test result. A thematic analysis approach was applied. RESULTS: The 58 informants (29 female) reported that Nigeria has limited availability of conventional provider-delivered SARS-CoV-2 testing. While just a few informants were familiar with SARS-CoV-2 self-testing, they generally supported using self-testing as an approach that they felt could assist with early case detection and improve access to testing. Concerns relating to the use of self-testing mainly related to the ability of low-literate individuals to use and interpret the self-tests, the affordability of self-tests, equity of access, and the availability of healthcare system support for those who self-test positive. CONCLUSION: Although the Nigerian public perceive multiple benefits associated with access to SARS-CoV-2 self-testing, the perceived inefficiency of the national health service delivery system may limit the access of users of the kits to psychosocial and clinical support. Nevertheless, in Nigeria, where COVID-19 vaccine coverage is low and the risk of further waves of COVID-19 is high, self-testing may assist in the prompt detection of cases and contribute to halting the spread of the virus.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37053243/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/PONE-D-22-19733 https://sci-hub.do/10.1371/journal.pone.0282570", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 35215772, "aid": "v14020175 viruses-14-00175 10.3390/v14020175", "titl": "Distinct Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients with Positive or Negative RT-PCR Test.", "mesh": "Academic Medical Centers/statistics & numerical data;;; Aged;;; Brazil;;; COVID-19/*diagnosis/mortality/virology;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing/methods/*statistics & numerical data;;; Female;;; Hospital Mortality;;; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data;;; Humans;;; Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data;;; Male;;; Middle Aged;;; Nasopharynx/virology;;; Retrospective Studies;;; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*statistics & numerical data;;; Risk Factors;;; SARS-CoV-2/*genetics", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Saad Menezes, Maria Clara; Santinelli Pestana, Diego Vinicius; Ferreira, Juliana Carvalho; Ribeiro de Carvalho, Carlos Roberto; Felix, Marcelo Consorti; Marcilio, Izabel Oliva; da Silva, Katia Regina; Junior, Vilson Cobello; Marchini, Julio Flavio; Alencar, Julio Cesar; Gomez, Luz Marina Gomez; Maua, Denis Deratani; Souza, Heraldo Possolo; Emergency Usp Covid-Group; Hcfmusp Covid-Study Group", "jour": "Viruses", "affl": "Emergency Medicine Department, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903, Brazil.;;; Emergency Medicine Department, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903, Brazil.;;; Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903l, Brazil.;;; Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903l, Brazil.;;; Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903l, Brazil.;;; Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903l, Brazil.;;; Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903l, Brazil.;;; Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903l, Brazil.;;; Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903l, Brazil.;;; Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903l, Brazil.;;; Emergency Medicine Department, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903, Brazil.;;; Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05508-090, Brazil.;;; Emergency Medicine Department, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903, Brazil.;;; Emergency Medicine Department, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903, Brazil.;;; Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 01246-903l, Brazil.", "pdat": "2022 Jan 18", "tiab": "Identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample is a common test for diagnosing COVID-19.

Conversely, lateral flow immunoassays are suitable for rapid point-of-care tests but have limited sensitivity. Here, we describe the development of a rapid and sensitive magnetofluidic immuno-PCR platform that can address the current gap in point-of-care serological testing for COVID-19.

In the device, a programmable magnetic arm attracts and transports magnetically-captured antibodies through assay reagents pre-loaded in a companion plastic cartridge, and a miniaturized thermocycler and a fluorescence detector perform immuno-PCR to detect the antibodies. We evaluated our magnetofluidic immuno-PCR with 108 clinical serum/plasma samples and achieved 93.8% (45/48) sensitivity and 98.3% (59/60) specificity, demonstrating its potential as a rapid and sensitive point-of-care serological test for COVID-19.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34600203/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0956-5663(21)00693-X https://sci-hub.do/113656 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113656", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 34797267, "aid": "00124784-202201001-00016 10.1097/PHH.0000000000001445", "titl": "Community-Informed Mobile COVID-19 Testing Model to Addressing Health Inequities.", "mesh": "*COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; Residence Characteristics;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Jimenez, Jonathan; Parra, Yury J; Murphy, Katherine; Chen, Alexandra Nixxi; Cook, Andrew; Watkins, Jacob; Baker, Melissa D; Sung, Semi; Kaur, Guneet; Kress, Marielle; Kurien, Sarah Joseph; Keeley, Chris; Long, Theodore", "jour": "Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP", "affl": "NYC Health + Hospitals/Test & Trace Corps, New York City, New York (Drs Jimenez, Parra, and Long, Mss Murphy, Chen, Kress, and Kurien, and Messrs Cook, Watkins, and Keeley); National Black Leadership Commission on Health, New York City, New York (Ms Baker); The Korean Community Services of Metropolitan New York, Inc, Bayside, New York (Dr Sung); and United Sikhs (Ms Kaur), New York, NY.", "pdat": "2022 Jan-Feb 01", "tiab": "CONTEXT: The New York City (NYC) Test & Trace Corps (Test & Trace), under New York City Health + Hospitals (NYC H+H), set out to provide universal access to COVID-19 testing. Test & Trace partnered with numerous organizations to direct mobile COVID-19 testing from concept through implementation to reduce COVID-19-related health inequities. PROGRAM: Test & Trace employs a community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model to deliver testing to the hardest-hit, underserved communities. Community partners, uniquely knowledgeable of the residents they serve, are engaged as decision makers and operational partners in mobile COVID-19 testing delivery. IMPLEMENTATION: Through several mobile testing methods, community partners choose testing locations and tailor outreach to their community. Test & Trace assumes logistical responsibility for mobile testing but defers critical programmatic decisions and community engagement to partners. Integral to the success of this program is responsive, bidirectional communication. EVALUATION: During the reporting period of December 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model provided testing to 150351 unique patients and processed 274083 tests in total. The available outcomes data and qualitative feedback provided by community partners illustrate that this intervention, combined with robust governmental investment, successfully ensured that NYC-identified, low-resource neighborhoods had greater access to COVID-19 testing. DISCUSSION: Making community partners decision makers reduced inequities in access to testing for communities of color. In addition, the model has served as the framework for Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 vaccination program, operated in concert with NYC's Vaccine Command Center, and is a foundation for addressing health inequities at scale, including during public health crises.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34797267/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/00124784-202201001-00016 https://sci-hub.do/10.1097/PHH.0000000000001445", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United States", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 35442453, "aid": "2791306 zoi220250 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.8071", "titl": "Effectiveness of mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and JNJ-78436735 COVID-19 Vaccines Among US Military Personnel Before and During the Predominance of the Delta Variant.", "mesh": "2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; Ad26COVS1;;; Adult;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Case-Control Studies;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Male;;; *Military Personnel;;; SARS-CoV-2/genetics", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Eick-Cost, Angelia A; Ying, Saixia; Wells, Natalie", "jour": "JAMA network open", "affl": "Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, Defense Health Agency, Silver Spring, Maryland.;;; Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, Defense Health Agency, Silver Spring, Maryland.;;; Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, Defense Health Agency, Silver Spring, Maryland.", "pdat": "2022 Apr 1", "tiab": "IMPORTANCE: No studies to date have evaluated the effectiveness of 3 COVID-19 vaccines in the US military population, especially during the circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and JNJ-78436735 vaccines among US military personnel before and during the predominance of the Delta variant in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study was conducted among all unvaccinated and fully vaccinated US military personnel who had a documented SARS-CoV-2 test performed in the US between January 1 and September 24, 2021. Individuals were identified using Department of Defense (DOD) electronic medical, laboratory, and surveillance databases. The pre-Delta period was defined as January 1 to May 31, 2021, and the Delta period as June 19 to September 24, 2021. Case individuals were defined by a positive polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 test result or a positive antigen test result with symptoms. Control individuals had at least 1 negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 vaccination with the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, or JNJ-78436735 vaccine, assessed from DOD electronic vaccination records. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness overall, by vaccine type, and by outcome stratified by the pre-Delta and Delta periods in the US. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 100 x (1 - odds ratio) in a logistic regression model with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: The cohort included 441\u202f379 individuals, with 290\u202f256 in the pre-Delta period (236\u202f555 [81%] male; median age, 25 years [range, 17-68 years]) and 151\u202f123 in the Delta period (120\u202f536 [80%] male; median age, 26 years [range, 17-70 years]). Adjusted vaccine effectiveness of all vaccines was significantly higher during the pre-Delta period (89.2%; 95% CI, 88.1%-90.1%) compared with the Delta period (70.2%; 95% CI, 69.3%-71.1%) for all outcomes, an overall decrease of 19%. mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness was highest in the pre-Delta (93.5%; 95% CI, 91.9%-94.7%) and Delta (79.4%; 95% CI, 78.3%-80.4%) periods for all outcomes, whereas the JNJ-78436735 vaccine had the lowest effectiveness during the pre-Delta (81.8%; 95% CI, 74.2%- 87.1%) and Delta (38.3%; 95% CI, 34.5%-41.9%) periods. Effectiveness for all vaccines during both periods was higher for symptomatic infection and hospitalization among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case-control study, among US military personnel, COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness was significantly lower during the period when the Delta variant predominated compared with the period before Delta variant predominance; this was especially true for the JNJ-78436735 vaccine. These findings were confounded by time since vaccination; this and the change in effectiveness support the need for booster doses and continued evaluation of vaccine effectiveness as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35442453/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/2791306 https://sci-hub.do/zoi220250 https://sci-hub.do/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.8071", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United States", "topic": 3, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35891507, "aid": "v14071527 viruses-14-01527 10.3390/v14071527", "titl": "An Updated Review on SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Animals.", "mesh": "Animals;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Humans;;; Pandemics;;; *SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Cui, Shujuan; Liu, Yimeng; Zhao, Jiachen; Peng, Xiaomin; Lu, Guilan; Shi, Weixian; Pan, Yang; Zhang, Daitao; Yang, Peng; Wang, Quanyi", "jour": "Viruses", "affl": "Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.;;; Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.;;; Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.;;; Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.;;; Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.;;; Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.;;; Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.;;; Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.;;; Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.;;; Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 100013, China.", "pdat": "2022 Jul 13", "tiab": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has lasted for two years and caused millions of infections and deaths in humans.

Moreover, respiratory samples in viral transport media are the ideal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In early 2021, many clinicians transitioned to antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, which use anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Despite this shift in testing methods, the need for whole-genome sequence surveillance remains. Thus, we developed a workflow for whole-genome sequencing with antigen test-derived swabs as an input rather than nasopharyngeal swabs.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) conducted during July to October 2021. SETTING: HPS is designed to yield representative estimates of the US population aged >/=18 years nationally, by state and across selected metropolitan areas. PARTICIPANTS: Our primary analytical sample was adult HCWs in the New York Metropolitan area (n=555), with HCWs defined as individuals who reported working in a 'Hospital'; 'Nursing and residential healthcare facility'; 'Pharmacy' or 'Ambulatory healthcare setting'. In the entire national sample, n=25 909 HCWs completed the survey. Descriptive analyses were performed with HCW data from the New York Metropolitan area, the original epicentre of the pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on pooled national HCW data to explore how HCW COVID-19-related experiences, perceptions and behaviours varied as a function of broader geographic, clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of HCWs surveyed in the New York Metropolitan area, 92.3% reported being fully vaccinated, and 20.9% had ever been diagnosed of COVID-19.

Within pooled multivariable analysis of the national HCW sample, personnel in nursing/residential facilities were less likely to be fully vaccinated (adjusted OR, AOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98) and more likely to report ever COVID-19 diagnosis (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.62), than those working in hospitals. Of HCWs not yet vaccinated nationally, vaccine-unsure individuals were more likely to be White and work in pharmacies, whereas vaccine-accepting individuals were more likely to be employed by non-profit organisations and work in ambulatory care facilities.

This investigation examined the association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination status and mortality among SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS & FINDINGS: A retrospective, registry-based chart review was conducted investigating COVID-19 mortality among immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients in a large metropolitan healthcare system in Houston, Texas, USA. Electronic health record data was collected from consecutive SOT recipients who received a diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 test between March 1, 2020, and October 1, 2021. The primary exposure was COVID-19 vaccination status at time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients were considered 'fully vaccinated' at fourteen days after completing their vaccine course. COVID-19 mortality within 60 days and intensive care unit admission within 30 days were primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. Among 646 SOT recipients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Houston Methodist Hospital between March 2020, and October 2021, 70 (10.8%) expired from COVID-19 within 60 days. Transplanted organs included 63 (9.8%) heart, 355 (55.0%) kidney, 108 (16.7%) liver, 70 (10.8%) lung, and 50 (7.7%) multi-organ. Increasing age was a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, while vaccination within 180 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was protective in Cox proportional hazard models with hazard ratio 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.06) and 0.31 (0.11-0.90), respectively). These findings were confirmed in the propensity score matched cohort between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.

METHODS: Between October 1, 2021, and February 12, 2022, research staff consented and enrolled eligible participants who had fever, cough, or loss of taste or smell and sought outpatient medical care or clinical SARS-CoV-2 testing within 10 days of illness onset. Using the test-negative design, we compared the odds of receiving two or three mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses among SARS-CoV-2 cases versus controls using logistic regression. Regression models were adjusted for study site, age, onset week, and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as (1 - adjusted odds ratio) x 100%. RESULTS: Among 3847 participants included for analysis, 574 (32%) of 1775 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta predominant period and 1006 (56%) of 1794 participants tested positive during the Omicron predominant period. When Delta predominated, VE against symptomatic illness in outpatient settings was 63% (95% CI: 51% to 72%) among mRNA two-dose recipients and 96% (95% CI: 93% to 98%) for three-dose recipients. When Omicron predominated, VE was 21% (95% CI: -6% to 41%) among two-dose recipients and 62% (95% CI: 48% to 72%) among three-dose recipients. CONCLUSIONS: In this adult population, three mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses provided substantial protection against symptomatic illness in outpatient settings when the Omicron variant became the predominant cause of COVID-19 in the United States.

However, between June 2021 and February 2022, the proportion of people having received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose was higher among this group (96%) than among individuals who were not visible minorities (93%). A better understanding of successful approaches and the challenges experienced by those who remain unvaccinated among this highly vaccinated group may improve public health outreach in subsequent waves of the current pandemic or for future pandemic planning. Using qualitative methods, we sought to explore the perceptions of COVID-19 risk, vaccine access, uptake and confidence among South Asians living in Canada. DESIGN: Semistructured interviews conducted with 25 participants analysed using thematic analysis. Throughout this process, we held frequent discussions with members of the study's advisory group to guide data collection (community engagement, recruitment and data analysis). SETTING: Communities of the GTHA and GVA with interviews conducted virtually over Zoom or telephone. PARTICIPANTS: 25 participants (15 from Ontario and 10 from British Columbia) were interviewed between July 2021 and January 2022. 10 individuals were community members, 9 were advocacy group leaders and 6 were public health staff. RESULTS: Access to and confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine was impacted by individual risk perceptions; sources of trusted information (ethnic and non-ethnic); impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic on individuals, families and society; and experiences with COVID-19 mandates and policies (including temporal and generational differences). Approaches that include community-level awareness and tailored outreach (language and cultural context) were considered successful. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding factors and developing strategies that build vaccine confidence and improve access can guide approaches that increase vaccine acceptance in the current and future pandemics.Visual abstract can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iXdnJj9ssc3hXCllZxP0QA9DhHH-7uwB/view.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37015794/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/bmjopen-2022-070433 https://sci-hub.do/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-070433", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "England", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35188408, "aid": "10.4155/bio-2021-0176", "titl": "China's NMPA perspective on the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen test reagents.", "mesh": "Antigens, Viral;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;;; COVID-19 Serological Testing/*methods;;; China;;; Clinical Trials as Topic;;; Humans;;; Indicators and Reagents;;; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic;;; SARS-CoV-2/immunology;;; Specimen Handling/*methods", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Lv, Yunfeng; Gao, Yu; He, Jingyun; Xu, Chao; Liu, Rongzhi; Zheng, Shengwei; Fang, Li; Han, Congyin; Li, Ran", "jour": "Bioanalysis", "affl": "Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA, Beijing, 100081, PR China.;;; Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA, Beijing, 100081, PR China.;;; Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA, Beijing, 100081, PR China.;;; Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA, Beijing, 100081, PR China.;;; Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA, Beijing, 100081, PR China.;;; Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA, Beijing, 100081, PR China.;;; Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA, Beijing, 100081, PR China.;;; Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA, Beijing, 100081, PR China.;;; Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA, Beijing, 100081, PR China.", "pdat": "2022 Mar", "tiab": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread all over the world.

RECENT FINDINGS: There is no internationally agreed definition of PCC, although now most researchers agree that it is a complex clinical symptomatology persisting for at least 3 months after COVID-19, without an alternative diagnosis. There are several uncertainties about paediatric PCC. So far, available literature suggest that 1-3% of recognized children with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may develop PCC. Its pathogenesis is unknown, although there is increasing evidence about possible abnormalities in the immune responses, cellular metabolism and intestinal microbiota, along with chronic endothelitis.

During the observational period of 68 (IQR, 66-70) days, AEs occurred in 57.9% and 61.9% of patients after the first dose and second dose, respectively. The most common AEs were: injection-site pain (61.9%), erythema (4.8%), itching (4.8%), swelling (16.7%), axillary swelling/tenderness (2.4%), fever (17.5%) headache (7.9%), fatigue (23.8%), myalgia (17.5%), arthralgia (12.7%), dyspnoea (2.4%), nausea/vomiting (7.1%), diarrhoea (5.6%), shivers (4%) and vertigo (1.6%). The rates of local AEs were similar after the first and second doses (P=0.8), whereas systemic AEs occurred more frequently after the second dose (P=0.001). Fever (P=0.03), fatigue (P=0.02) and nausea/vomiting (P=0.03) were significantly more frequent after the second dose of the vaccine. There were no age-related differences in the rate of AEs. Overall, vaccine-related AEs in hemodialysis patients seem to be lower than in the general population. Conclusion: The RNA-1273 vaccine was associated with the development of transient AEs after the first and second doses in patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis. They were mostly local, whereas systemic AEs were more prevalent after the second dose. Overall, all AEs lasted for a few days, without any apparent sequelae.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35470997/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/39-02-2022-05", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Italy", "topic": 2, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 33894979, "aid": "S0002-9610(21)00234-8 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2021.04.005", "titl": "Increased complications in patients who test COVID-19 positive after elective surgery and implications for pre and postoperative screening.", "mesh": "Adult;;; COVID-19/complications/*epidemiology/immunology/virology;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing/*statistics & numerical data;;; Elective Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Incidence;;; Male;;; Mass Screening/*statistics & numerical data;;; Middle Aged;;; Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/immunology;;; Postoperative Period;;; Preoperative Period;;; Prospective Studies;;; Risk Factors;;; SARS-CoV-2/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification;;; United States/epidemiology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Prasad, Nikhil K; Lake, Rachel; Englum, Brian R; Turner, Douglas J; Siddiqui, Tariq; Mayorga-Carlin, Minerva; Sorkin, John D; Lal, Brajesh K", "jour": "American journal of surgery", "affl": "Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; Surgery Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; Surgery Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; Surgery Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Surgery Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; Surgery Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Geriatrics Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA; Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; Surgery Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.

This typically involves a preoperative symptom screen and nasal swab RT-PCR test for viral RNA. Asymptomatic patients with a negative COVID-19 test are cleared for surgery. However, little is known about the rate of postoperative COVID-19 positivity among elective surgical patients, risk factors for this group and rate of complications. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study included all patients undergoing elective surgery at 170 Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals across the United States. Patients were divided into groups based on first positive COVID-19 test within 30 days after surgery (COVID[-/+]), before surgery (COVID[+/-]) or negative throughout (COVID[-/-]). The cumulative incidence, risk factors for and complications of COVID[-/+], were estimated using univariate analysis, exact matching, and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Between March 1 and December 1, 2020 90,093 patients underwent elective surgery. Of these, 60,853 met inclusion criteria, of which 310 (0.5%) were in the COVID[-/+] group. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression identified female sex, end stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, cancer, cirrhosis, and undergoing neurosurgical procedures as risk factors for being in the COVID[-/+] group. After matching on current procedural terminology code and month of procedure, multivariable Poisson regression estimated the complication rate ratio for the COVID[-/+] group vs. COVID[-/-] to be 8.4 (C.I. 4.9-14.4) for pulmonary complications, 3.0 (2.2, 4.1) for major complications, and 2.6 (1.9, 3.4) for any complication. DISCUSSION: Despite preoperative COVID-19 screening, there remains a risk of COVID infection within 30 days after elective surgery. This risk is increased for patients with a high comorbidity burden and those undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Higher intensity preoperative screening and closer postoperative monitoring is warranted in such patients because they have a significantly elevated risk of postoperative complications.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33894979/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0002-9610(21)00234-8 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2021.04.005", "pt": "Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "pl": "United States", "topic": 5, "prop": 0.6282209264857004}, {"uid": 37167154, "aid": "mm7219e1 10.15585/mmwr.mm7219e1", "titl": "COVID-19 Surveillance After Expiration of the Public Health Emergency Declaration - United States, May 11, 2023.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Public Health;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; United States/epidemiology;;; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring;;; *Sentinel Surveillance", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Silk, Benjamin J; Scobie, Heather M; Duck, William M; Palmer, Tess; Ahmad, Farida B; Binder, Alison M; Cisewski, Jodi A; Kroop, Seth; Soetebier, Karl; Park, Meeyoung; Kite-Powell, Aaron; Cool, Andrea; Connelly, Erin; Dietz, Stephanie; Kirby, Amy E; Hartnett, Kathleen; Johnston, Jocelyn; Khan, Diba; Stokley, Shannon; Paden, Clinton R; Sheppard, Michael; Sutton, Paul; Razzaghi, Hilda; Anderson, Robert N; Thornburg, Natalie; Meyer, Sarah; Womack, Caryn; Weakland, Aliki P; McMorrow, Meredith; Broeker, Lanson R; Winn, Amber; Hall, Aron J; Jackson, Brendan; Mahon, Barbara E; Ritchey, Matthew D", "jour": "MMWR.

Globally, multiple strategies have been utilized for the screening of HCWs. This article reports and evaluates an active surveillance and screening strategy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) among HCWs following work or nonwork exposures in Brunei Darussalam to prevent health care-associated COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: In March 2020, the Ministry of Health through the Occupational Health Division adopted an active screening strategy for symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs, which involved symptom screening, risk assessment, SARS-COV-2 testing, and management following work/nonwork exposure and recent overseas travel, and those with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. Screening frequency was based on the HCWs' symptoms and exposure, with the intent to evaluate all possible sources of exposure. FINDINGS: As of December 31, 2020, 821 HCWs were screened, of which 632 (77%) had ILI symptoms and 14 (1.7%) had high-risk occupational exposure. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab testing was carried out on 577 (70.3%) HCWs, with the highest proportion of swabs done on doctors (85.1%; p < .01) due to their workplace exposure (34.3%) and overseas travel (38.7%). CONCLUSION: By July 2021, Brunei Darussalam had recorded zero cases of COVID-19 among HCWs from occupational exposure.

The inability to comprehensively control COVID-19 is due to the difficulty of early and timely diagnosis, the lack of effective therapeutic drugs, and the limited effectiveness of vaccines. The body contains billions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have shown remarkable potential in disease diagnosis, drug development, and vaccine carriers. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that EVs may participate or assist the body in defence, antagonism, recovery and acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, intercepting and decrypting the general intelligence carried in circulating EVs from COVID-19 patients will provide an important hint for diagnosis and treatment; on the other hand, engineered EVs modified by gene editing in the laboratory will amplify the effectiveness of inhibiting infection, replication and destruction of ever-mutating SARS-CoV-2, facilitating tissue repair and making a better vaccine. To comprehensively understand the interaction between EVs and SARS-CoV-2, providing new insights to overcome some difficulties in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19, we conducted a rounded review in this area. We also explain numerous critical challenges that these tactics face before they enter the clinic, and this work will provide previous 'meet change with constancy' lessons for responding to future similar public health disasters. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a 'meet changes with constancy' strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 that spans defence, antagonism, recovery, and acquired immunity. Targets for COVID-19 diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of progression may be found by capture of the message decoding in circulating EVs.

This restriction hampered assessment of the true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children as well as detailed characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 disease spectrum and how this spectrum compared with that of other common respiratory illnesses. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the community incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and parents and to assess the symptoms and symptom severity of respiratory illness episodes involving SARS-CoV-2-positive test results relative to those with SARS-CoV-2-negative test results. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study randomly selected Dutch households with at least 1 child younger than 18 years. A total of 1209 children and adults from 307 households were prospectively followed up between August 25, 2020, and July 29, 2021, covering the second and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participation included SARS-CoV-2 screening at 4- to 6-week intervals during the first 23 weeks of participation (core study period; August 25, 2020, to July 29, 2021). Participants in all households finishing the core study before July 1, 2021, were invited to participate in the extended follow-up and to actively report respiratory symptoms using an interactive app until July 1, 2021. At new onset of respiratory symptoms or a SARS-CoV-2 positive test result, a household outbreak study was initiated, which included daily symptom recording, repeated polymerase chain reaction testing (nose-throat swabs and saliva and fecal samples), and SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement (paired dried blood spots) in all household members. Outbreaks, households, and episodes of respiratory illness were described as positive or negative depending on SARS-CoV-2 test results. Data on participant race and ethnicity were not reported because they were not uniformly collected in the original cohorts and were therefore not representative or informative. EXPOSURES: SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory illness episodes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-stratified incidence rates, symptoms, and symptom severity for SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory illness episodes. RESULTS: Among 307 households including 1209 participants (638 female [52.8%]; 403 [33.3%] aged <12 years, 179 [14.8%] aged 12-17 years, and 627 [51.9%] aged >/=18 years), 183 household outbreaks of respiratory illness were observed during the core study and extended follow-up period, of which 63 (34.4%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive (59 outbreaks [32.2%] during the core study and 4 outbreaks [2.2%] during follow-up). SARS-CoV-2 incidence was similar across all ages (0.24/person-year [PY]; 95% CI, 0.21-0.28/PY). Overall, 33 of 134 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 episodes (24.6%) were asymptomatic. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory illness episodes was highest in children younger than 12 years (0.94/PY; 95% CI, 0.89-0.97/PY). When comparing SARS-CoV-2-positive vs SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory illness episodes in children younger than 12 years, no differences were observed in number of symptoms (median [IQR], 2 [2-4] for both groups), symptom severity (median [IQR] maximum symptom severity score, 6 [4-9] vs 7 [6-13]), or symptom duration (median [IQR], 6 [5-12] days vs 8 [4-13] days). However, among adults, SARS-CoV-2-positive episodes had a significantly higher number (median [IQR], 6 [4-8] vs 3 [2-4]), severity (median [IQR] maximum symptom severity score, 15 [9-19] vs 7 [6-11]), and duration (median [IQR] 13 [8-29] days vs 5 [3-11] days; P < .001 for all comparisons) of symptoms vs SARS-CoV-2-negative episodes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, during the first pandemic year when mostly partial or full in-person learning occurred, the SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate in children was substantially higher than estimated from routine testing or seroprevalence data and was similar to that of adult household members. Unlike in unvaccinated adults, SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and symptom severity in children were similar to other common respiratory illnesses.

The current crisis has created an unprecedented demand for rapid test of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a fast and convenient method to amplify and identify the transcripts of a targeted pathogen. However, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP were generally regarded as inferior when compared with the gold standard RT-qPCR. To address this issue, we combined bioinformatic and experimental analyses to improve the assay performance for COVID-19 diagnosis. FINDINGS: First, by experimental screening as well as high-throughput sequencing studies, we discovered new primer features that impacted LAMP sensitivity and specificity. These features were then used to build an improved bioinformatics algorithm to design LAMP primers targeting SARS-CoV-2. We further rigorously validated these new assays for their efficacy and specificity. We demonstrated that multiplexed RT-LAMP assay could directly detect as low as 1.5 copies/microL of SARS-CoV-2 particles in saliva, without the need of RNA isolation. We further tested this ultra-sensitive and specific RT-LAMP assay using saliva samples from COVID-19 patients. Clinical validation results indicated that the new RT-LAMP assay was comparable to standard RT-qPCR in overall assay sensitivity and specificity. INTERPRETATION: In summary, our new LAMP primer design algorithm along with the validated assays provide a fast and reliable method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases.

Rapid antigen detection tests are less expensive and easier to implement, but their diagnostic performance has been questioned compared to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Here, we evaluate the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and predicting contagiousness compared to RT-PCR and viral culture, respectively. The antigen test was 100.0% specific but only 40.9% sensitive for diagnosing infection compared to RT-PCR. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 contagiousness is highly unlikely with a negative antigen test since it exhibited a negative predictive value of 99.9% compared to viral culture. Furthermore, a cycle threshold (C(T)) value of 18.1 in RT-PCR was shown to be the one that best predicts contagiousness (area under the curve [AUC], 97.6%). Thus, screening people with antigen testing is a good approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 contagion and allow returning to daily activities. IMPORTANCE The importance of our results is the excellent agreement between the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test and the viral culture, indicating that it is important as a marker of contagiousness. Due to its high positive predictive value in situations of a high prevalence of infection, positive results do not require confirmation with another test. Likewise, its high negative predictive value for contagiousness makes possible to use this test as a criterion to discharge patients in isolation and screen people moving into environments that could facilitate the transmission of the virus.

Our objective is to comment on its impact and to suggest that, threatening as it is, Omicron may well contribute to a resolution of the current pandemic. COMMENT: On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Soon after, Chinese investigators who made the discovery identified the causative virus as a new coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). An effective vaccine was licenced for emergency use within a year of its first sequencing. SARS-CoV-2, in common with many respiratory viruses, mutates rapidly, and the challenge for vaccine developers is to obtain vaccines that are effective against the new variants. The licenced first-generation vaccines were fortunately all highly effective against the variant known as Delta. The variant of greatest current concern is the Omicron variant, a highly infectious agent, which seems to show a significant vaccine escape with existing vaccines. Infection protects against further infection. If Omicron turns out to cause less severe disease, it may well be a contributor to ending the pandemic. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: It is unlikely that the available vaccines will bring rapid control of the current pandemic, given their patchy availability worldwide and the residual pool of unvaccinated people. New vaccines take time to develop and to deploy even in the age of mRNA vaccines. If Omicron turns out to be relatively mild, it may well be that when we look back at the history of the current pandemic, the variant would be seen as a contributor to its solution.

Sera from vaccinated obese individuals (n = 73) and normal BMI controls (n = 46) were subjected to S-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and serum-neutralization test (SNT) to determine the prevalence and titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Nucleocapsid-ELISA was also utilized to distinguish between immunity acquired via vaccination only versus vaccination plus recovery from infection. Data were linked to participant demographics including age, gender, past COVID-19 diagnosis, and COVID-19 vaccination profile. S-based ELISA demonstrated high seroprevalence rates (>97%) in the study and control groups whether samples with evidence of past infection were included or excluded. Interestingly, however, SNT demonstrated a slightly significant reduction in both the rate and titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies among vaccinated obese individuals (60/73; 82.19%) compared to controls (45/46; 97.83%). The observed reduction in COVID-19 vaccine-induced neutralizing humoral immunity among obese individuals occurs independently of gender, recovery from past infection, and period from last vaccination.

Following PRISMA-P protocol, we conducted a systematic review. The search strategy combined synonyms of health-care behaviors and knowledge. Reviewers synthesized key themes across articles and assessed studies utilizing modified Newcastle-Ottawa criteria. Of the 2,518 articles, 32 were selected. Asian Americans reported greater COVID-19 vaccination willingness and decreased COVID-19 testing relative to other racial groups. Common COVID-19 vaccination concerns included vaccination side effects, long-term safety, and distrust of COVID-19 information sources. Asian Americans had high COVID-19 preventative behavior rates including mask-wearing, handwashing, and social isolation compared to other ethnic groups. Asian Americans, conversely, had lower COVID-19-related healthcare knowledge and telemedicine adoption levels relative to other participants. This systematic review informs public health officials and clinicians of COVID-19 related healthcare knowledge and behaviors in the Asian American population.

We explore the direction and magnitude of potential biases in these estimates and their implications for vaccine protection against infection and against disease in breakthrough infections. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model that accounts for natural and vaccine-induced immunity, changes in serostatus, and imperfect sensitivity and specificity of tests for infection and antibodies. We estimated expected biases in VE against symptomatic, asymptomatic, and any severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and against disease following infection for a range of vaccine characteristics and measurement approaches, and the likely overall biases for published trial results that included asymptomatic infections. RESULTS: VE against asymptomatic infection measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology is expected to be low or negative for vaccines that prevent disease but not infection. VE against any infection is overestimated when asymptomatic infections are less likely to be detected than symptomatic infections and the vaccine protects against symptom development. A competing bias toward underestimation arises for estimates based on tests with imperfect specificity, especially when testing is performed frequently. Our model indicates considerable uncertainty in Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S VE against any infection, with slightly higher than published, bias-adjusted values of 59.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38.4-77.1) and 70.9% (95% UI 49.8-80.7), respectively.

Because capacity for RT-PCR testing increased greatly in the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, R0 determinations based on these incidence values are subject to strong bias. We propose to use Covid-19-induced excess mortality to determine R0 regardless of RT-PCR testing capacity. We used data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) on the incidence of Covid cases, Covid-related deaths, number of RT-PCR tests performed, and excess mortality calculated from data from the Federal Statistical Office in Germany. We determined R0 using exponential growth estimates with a serial interval of 4.7 days. We used only datasets that were not yet under the influence of policy measures (e.g., lockdowns or school closures). The uncorrected R0 value for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR incidence data was 2.56 (95% CI 2.52-2.60) for Covid-19 cases and 2.03 (95% CI 1.96-2.10) for Covid-19-related deaths. However, because the number of RT-PCR tests increased by a growth factor of 1.381 during the same period, these R0 values must be corrected accordingly (R0corrected = R0uncorrected/1.381), yielding 1.86 for Covid-19 cases and 1.47 for Covid-19 deaths. The R0 value based on excess deaths was calculated to be 1.34 (95% CI 1.32-1.37). A sine-function-based adjustment for seasonal effects of 40% corresponds to a maximum value of R0(January) = 1.68 and a minimum value of R0(July) = 1.01. Our calculations show an R0 that is much lower than previously thought. This relatively low range of R0 fits very well with the observed seasonal pattern of infection across Europe in 2020 and 2021, including the emergence of more contagious escape variants such as delta or omicron.

The presented model has been evaluated in simulations using fall 2019 (prepandemic) and fall 2020 (hybrid instruction) course registration data of a large US university, allowing for assessing the difference in transmission risk between in-person and hybrid programs and the impact of occupancy reduction, mask-wearing, and vaccination. The simulations indicate that without vaccination, moving 90% of the classes online leads to a 17 to 18x reduction in new cases, and universal mask usage results in an  approximately 2.7 to 3.6x reduction in new infections through classroom interactions. Furthermore, the results indicate that for the original variant and using vaccines with efficacy greater than 90%, at least 23% (64%) of students need to be vaccinated with (without) mask usage in order to operate the university at full occupancy while preventing an increase in cases due to classroom interactions. For the more contagious variant, even with universal mask usage, at least 93% of the students need to be vaccinated to ensure the same conditions. We show that the model is able to predict trends observed in weekly infection rates for fall 2021.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35609196/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/202116165 https://sci-hub.do/10.1073/pnas.2116165119", "pt": "Journal Article;

OBJECTIVE: To assess the analytical and clinical accuracy of 2 rapid diagnostic tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 during 3 phases of variants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic study included participants aged 18 years or older who reported onset of COVID-19-like symptoms within the prior 5 days and were tested at multiple COVID-19 testing locations in King County, Washington, from February 17, 2021, to January 11, 2022, during 3 distinct phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron). INTERVENTIONS: Two anterior nasal swab specimens were collected from each participant-1 for onsite testing by the SCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-Test and 1 for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The analytical limit of detection of the 2 rapid diagnostic tests (SCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-Test and BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card) was assessed using Omicron (B.1.1.529/BA.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and a wild-type (USA-WA1/2020) variant. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of clinical testing for the rapid antigen tests were compared with that of RT-PCR testing. RESULTS: A total of 802 participants were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 37.3 [13.3] years; 467 [58.2%] female), 424 (52.9%) of whom had not received COVID-19 vaccination and presented a median of 2 days (IQR, 1-3 days) from symptom onset. Overall, no significant differences were found in the analytical limit of detection or clinical diagnostic accuracy of rapid antigen testing across SARS-CoV-2 variants. The estimated limit of detection for both rapid nucleocapsid antigen tests was at or below a 50% tissue culture infectious dose of 62.5, and the positive percent agreement of the SCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-Test ranged from 81.2% (95% CI, 69.5%-89.9%) to 90.7% (95% CI, 77.9%-97.4%) across the 3 phases of variants. The diagnostic sensitivity increased for nasal swabs with a lower cycle threshold by RT-PCR, which correlates with a higher viral load. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this diagnostic study, analytical and clinical performance data demonstrated accuracy of 2 rapid antigen tests among adults with COVID-19 symptoms across 3 phases of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

METHODS: Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality were calculated using data from the National Public Health Centre surveillance database. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was calculated as 1 - incidence rate ratio >/=7 days after the second dose for each available vaccine versus an unvaccinated control group using mixed-effect negative binomial regression controlling for age, sex and calendar day. RESULTS: Between 22 January 2021 and 10 June 2021, 3 740 066 Hungarian individuals received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), HB02 (Sinopharm), Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik-V), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related death were 1.73-9.3/100 000 person-days and 0.04-0.65/100 000 person-days in the fully vaccinated population, respectively.

RESULTS: A total of 534 responses were received and analyzed. Almost half of the respondents were from Asia (50.9%), followed by Europe (38.8%). The majority of the respondents were <40 years old (88%), and almost two thirds were trainees (62.2%). Half of the respondents worked in departments with <40 beds (50.7%), and the majority were practicing in the private sector (72.5%).

METHODS: In total, 79 COVID-19-positive and 217 COVID-19-negative patients confirmed by RT-PCR were enrolled in this study. A duration from symptom onset to COVID-19 confirmation of <5 days was considered a recruiting criterion for COVID-19-positive cases.

Understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is insufficient, particularly in relation to those whose responses persist for more than 1 month after the onset of symptoms. We conducted a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test to identify factors affecting the serological response and to evaluate its diagnostic utility in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDING: We collected 1,048 residual serum samples from 396 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The samples had been used for routine admission tests in six healthcare institutions in Daegu. Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed and the cutoff index (COI) was calculated for quantitative analysis. The patients' information was reviewed to evaluate the relationship between antibody positivity and clinical characteristics. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate was 85% and the average COI was 24.3. The positivity rate and COI increased with time elapsed since symptom onset. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks after symptom onset at a high COI. There was a significant difference in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate between patients with and without symptoms, but not according to sex or disease course. The descending COI pattern at weeks 1 to 5 after symptom onset was significantly more frequent in patients who died than in those who recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted for at least 13 weeks at a high COI in patients with COVID-19. A decreasing COI pattern up to fifth week may be associated with a poor prognosis of COVID-19.

We previously reported national seroprevalence data from lateral flow testing of IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies up to 16 weeks after primary vaccination. Our aim here was to study IgG seropositivity dynamics up to 30 weeks after primary vaccination and, in CoronaVac recipients, up to 26 weeks after booster vaccination, and to establish the correlation between lateral flow tests and neutralising antibody titres. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, testing stations for SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection were selected and installed from March 12, 2021, in hotspots in 24 large Chilean cities, and were maintained until March 31, 2022. Individuals voluntarily approaching the testing stations were invited to perform a rapid lateral flow test via a finger prick and complete a questionnaire. Between Aug 12, 2021, and April 1, 2022, volunteers seeking medical care in the Mutual de Seguridad de la Camara Chilena de la Construccion provided blood samples for lateral flow testing and neutralising antibody studies; inclusion criteria were age at least 18 years, history of complete primary vaccination series with CoronaVac, BNT162b2, or ChAdOx1, or no vaccine, and no previous COVID-19 diagnosis. We tested the difference in IgG positivity across time, and between primary and booster doses, in all eligible participants with complete records, controlling for age, gender, and comorbidities. We also assessed the predictive power of neutralising antibody titres and sociodemographic characteristics on the probability of IgG positive results using multivariable logistic regression. FINDINGS: Of 107 220 individuals recruited at the testing stations, 101 070 were included in our analysis (59 862 [59.2%] women and 41 208 [40.8%] men). 65 902 (65.2%) received primary vaccination series with CoronaVac, 18 548 (18.4%) with BNT162b2, and 606 (0.6%) with ChAdOx1, and 16 014 (15.8%) received no vaccine. Among the 61 767 individuals with a complete primary vaccination series with CoronaVac, 608 (1.0%) received a CoronaVac booster, 10 095 (16.3%) received a BNT162b2 booster, and 5435 (8.8%) received a ChAdOx1 booster. After ChAdOx1 primary vaccination, seropositivity peaked at week 5 after the second dose, occurring in 13 (92.9%, 95% CI 79.4-100.0) of 14 individuals. In participants who received a complete CoronaVac primary series, the decline in seropositivity stabilised at week 18 after the second dose (86 [44.7%, 95% CI 41.8-47.7] of 1087 individuals), whereas after receiving BNT162b2, seropositivity declined slightly by week 25 after the second dose (161 [94.2%, 90.6-97.7] of 171). A lower proportion of individuals who received the CoronaVac primary series and a homologous booster were seropositive (279 [85.6%, 95% CI 81.8-89.4] of 326) by weeks 2-18 than those who received a BNT162b2 booster (7031 [98.6%, 98.4-98.9] of 7128) or a ChAdOx1 booster (2893 [98.0%, 97.5-98.5] of 2953). The correlation between IgG positivity and log of the infectious dose in 50% of neutralising antibodies was moderate, with a sensitivity of 81.4% (95% CI 76.3-86.6) and specificity of 92.5% (73.3-100.0). INTERPRETATION: Dynamic monitoring of IgG positivity to SARS-CoV-2 can characterise antibody waning over time in the absence or presence of booster doses, providing relevant data for the design of vaccination strategies. The correlation between lateral flow test IgG titres and neutralising antibody concentrations suggests that they could be a quick and effective surveillance tool to measure protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Because vaccine efficacy and antibody levels waned over time after the 2-shot primary series, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized a booster (third) dose for both mRNA vaccines to adults in the fall of 2021. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the magnitude and durability of S-RBD immunoglobulin (Ig)G after the booster mRNA vaccine dose in comparison to the primary series. We also compared S-RBD IgG levels after BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 boosters and explored effects of age and prior infection. METHODS: Surrounding receipt of the second and third homologous mRNA vaccine doses, adults in an employee-based cohort provided serum and completed questionnaires, including information about previous COVID-19 infection. The IgG to S-RBD was measured using an ImmunoCAP-based system. A subset of samples were assayed for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid by commercial assay. RESULTS: There were 228 subjects who had samples collected between 7 and 150 days after their primary series vaccine and 117 subjects who had samples collected in the same time frame after their boost. Antibody levels from 7 to 31 days after the primary series and booster were similar, but S-RBD IgG was more durable over time after the boost, regardless of prior infection status. In addition, mRNA-1273 post-boost antibody levels exceeded BNT162b2 out to 5 months.

A trans-government collaboration was created in April 2020 to independently evaluate the performance of commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays and help inform U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory decisions. To assess assay performance, three evaluation panels with similar antibody titer distributions were assembled. Each panel consisted of 110 samples with positive (n = 30) serum samples with a wide range of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and negative (n = 80) plasma and/or serum samples that were collected before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Each sample was characterized for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the spike protein using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Samples were selected for the panel when there was agreement on seropositivity by laboratories at National Cancer Institute's Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (NCI-FNLCR) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The sensitivity and specificity of each assay were assessed to determine Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) suitability. As of January 8, 2021, results from 91 evaluations were made publicly available (https://open.fda.gov/apis/device/covid19serology/, and https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/serology-surveillance/serology-test-evaluation.html). Sensitivity ranged from 27% to 100% for IgG (n = 81), from 10% to 100% for IgM (n = 74), and from 73% to 100% for total or pan-immunoglobulins (n = 5). The combined specificity ranged from 58% to 100% (n = 91). Approximately one-third (n = 27) of the assays evaluated are now authorized by FDA for emergency use. This collaboration established a framework for assay performance evaluation that could be used for future outbreaks and could serve as a model for other technologies. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic created a crucial need for accurate serology assays to evaluate seroprevalence and antiviral immune responses. The initial flood of serology assays entering the market with inadequate performance emphasized the need for independent evaluation of commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays using performance evaluation panels to determine suitability for use under EUA. Through a government-wide collaborative network, 91 commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assay evaluations were performed. Three evaluation panels with similar overall antibody titer distributions were assembled to evaluate performance. Nearly one-third of the assays evaluated met acceptable performance recommendations, and two assays had EUAs revoked and were removed from the U.S. market based on inadequate performance. Data for all serology assays evaluated are available at the FDA and CDC websites (https://open.fda.gov/apis/device/covid19serology/, and https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/serology-surveillance/serology-test-evaluation.html).", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35019677/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/01564-21 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.01564-21 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.01564-21", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "pl": "United States", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 35413022, "aid": "00126334-202208010-00002 10.1097/QAI.0000000000003000", "titl": "Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection Is Common Among ART-Treated People With HIV.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/complications;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; *Cardiovascular Diseases;;; Female;;; *HIV Infections/complications/drug therapy;;; Humans;;; Male;;; Middle Aged;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Overton, Edgar T; Weir, Isabelle R; Zanni, Markella V; Fischinger, Stephanie; MacArthur, Rodger D; Aberg, Judith A; Fitch, Kathleen V; Frank, Michael; Albrecht, Helmut; Goodenough, Elliot; Rhame, Frank S; Fichtenbaum, Carl J; Bloomfield, Gerald S; Malvestutto, Carlos; Supparatpinyo, Khuanchai; McCallum, Sara; Douglas, Pamela S; Alter, Galit; Ribaudo, Heather; Grinspoon, Steven K", "jour": "Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)", "affl": "Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.;;; Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research, Harvard T.H.

Data on a representative subset of PWH enrolled in Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV, a global clinical trial, are presented here. METHODS: Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV is an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention trial among 7770 PWH on antiretroviral therapy. Beginning April 2020, targeted data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis and symptoms were collected during routine trial visits. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was defined as either COVID-19 clinical diagnosis or presence of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G (IgG) or Immunoglobulin A (IgA) receptor binding domain protein (antispike) antibodies in the absence of prior COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: The group (N = 2464) had a median age 53 years, 35% female sex, 47% Black or African American race, median CD4 count 649 c/mm 3 , and 97% with HIV VL <400 cp/m. SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 318 persons (13%): 58 with clinical diagnosis and 260 with detectable antibodies. Of these PWH, 304 completed symptom questionnaires: 121 (40%) reported symptoms, but 183 (60%) were asymptomatic. PWH with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to be from low-income or middle-income regions, of Black or African American race, older in age, and with higher atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score. Symptomatic COVID was more common with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and low HDL levels. CD4 counts and HIV viral suppression rates were similar among PWH with symptomatic vs. asymptomatic COVID. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common among antiretroviral therapy-treated PWH globally. We determined that 60% of infections in PWH were asymptomatic.

Novel approaches against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are therefore urgently needed. Aptamers have been developed for the detection and inhibition of several different viruses such as HIV, influenza viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV.

This underscores the need for effective strategies for identifying carriers/patients, which was the main aim of this study. METHODS: We present a bubble-based PCR testing approach using swab-pooling into lysis buffer. A bubble is a cluster of people who can be periodically tested for SARS-CoV-2 by swab-pooling. A positive test of a pool mandates quarantining each of its members, who are then individually tested while in isolation to identify the carrier(s) for further epidemiological contact tracing. RESULTS: We tested an overall sample of 25 831 individuals, divided into 1273 bubbles, with an average size of 20.3 +/- 7.7 swabs/test tube, obtaining for all pools (</=37 swabs/pool) a specificity of 97.5% (lower bound 96.6%) and a sensitivity of 86.3% (lower bound 78.2%) and a post hoc analyzed sensitivity of 94.6% (lower bound 86.7%) and a specificity of 97.2% (lower bound 96.2%) in pools with </=25 swabs, relative to individual testing. DISCUSSION: This approach offers a significant scale-up in sampling and testing throughput and savings in testing cost, without reducing sensitivity or affecting the standard PCR testing laboratory routine.

It is now accepted that vaccination does not completely prevent infection and that breakthrough COVID-19 does occur. This study included 53 vaccinated patients who were hospitalized at a single center in Poland with breakthrough COVID-19 and aimed to evaluate the factors associated with their clinical course. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study covered the period 26 November 2021 to 11 March 2022. All patients had been vaccinated against COVID-19 with one of the following 4 vaccines: the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) mRNA vaccine (Spikevax); the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) (Comirnaty); the Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/J0ohnson & Johnson) recombinant vaccine (Jcovden); and the AZD1222 (ChAdOx1) (Oxford/AstraZeneca) recombinant vaccine (Vaxzevria). RESULTS The course of COVID-19 in vaccinated patients was relatively similar. The patients vaccinated more than 24 weeks earlier rarely needed a stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (P=0.021), and the occurrence of deaths was significantly lower in this group (P=0.046). Women remained in hospital considerably longer than men (P=0.011). Age and comorbidities did not affect the course of this infection.

METHODS: The in vitro technique of ID NOW COVID-19 was used in the analysis to evaluate the presence of SARS-Cov-2 in postmortem forensic cases. This isothermal method allows to amplify and identify the presence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase viral segment. Information on demographics, comorbidities, and the manner and cause of death was collected. RESULTS: A total of 612 subjects were sampled, of which 41 (6.7%) tested positive for COVID-19;14 (34.1%) of those subjects remained positive for more than 7 days Postmortem.

We investigated the immunogenicity and adverse events of the third dose of mRNA vaccines in healthy adults. METHODS: Volunteers vaccinated with two doses of the adenoviral vaccine (ChAdOx1) 12 weeks before were administered with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. These were divided into three groups, full-dose mRNA-1273 (group 1); half-dose mRNA-1273 (group 2); and full-dose BNT-162b2 (group 3). Primary outcomes included serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers and neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.617.2 (delta), and B.1.1.529 (omicron) variants. Secondary outcomes included the evaluation of humoral and cellular immunity and vaccine-associated adverse events after the boost. RESULTS: Totally 300 participants were recruited, and 298 participants were enrolled. For all three groups, an increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG geometric mean titers (30.12- to 71.80-fold) and neutralizing antibody titers against the alpha variant (69.80- to 173.23-folds), delta variant (132.69- to 324.63-folds), and omicron variant (135.36- to 222.37-folds) were observed on day 28. All groups showed robust T- and B-cell responses after boosting. Adverse events were overall mild and transient but with higher prevalence and severity in group 1 participants than in other groups.

METHODS: Results of all real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV\u20112 performed at our radio-oncology department between 13 October 2020 and 11 March 2021 were included. Clinical data and anamnestic information at the time of testing were documented and examined for (i) the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms and (ii) virus-related anamnesis (high-risk [prior positive test or contact to a positive tested person within the last 14 days] or low-risk [inconspicuous anamnesis within the last 14 days]). RESULTS: A total of 1056 SARS-CoV\u20112 tests in 543 patients were analyzed. Of those, 1015 tests were performed in asymptomatic patients and 41 tests in patients with COVID-19-associated symptoms. Two of 940 (0.2%) tests in asymptomatic patients with low-risk anamnesis and three of 75 (4.0%) tests in asymptomatic patients with high-risk anamnesis showed a positive result. For symptomatic patients, SARS-CoV\u20112 was detected in three of 36 (8.3%) low-risk and three of five (60.0%) high-risk tests. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the correlation between individual risk factors and positivity rates of SARS-CoV\u20112 tests in cancer patients. The data demonstrate that clinical and anamnestic assessment is a simple and effective measure to distinctly increase SARS-CoV\u20112 test efficiency.

We compared protection conferred by natural infection versus that from the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in Qatar. METHODS: We conducted two matched retrospective cohort studies that emulated target trials. Data were obtained from the national federated databases for COVID-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death between Feb 28, 2020 (pandemic onset in Qatar) and May 12, 2022. We matched individuals with a documented primary infection and no vaccination record (natural infection cohort) with individuals who had received two doses (primary series) of the same vaccine (BNT162b2-vaccinated or mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohorts) at the start of follow-up (90 days after the primary infection). Individuals were exact matched (1:1) by sex, 10-year age group, nationality, comorbidity count, and timing of primary infection or first-dose vaccination. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death in the natural infection cohorts was compared with incidence in the vaccinated cohorts, using Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for matching factors. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2021 (date of second-dose vaccine roll-out) and May 12, 2022, 104 500 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 and 61 955 individuals vaccinated with mRNA-1273 were matched to unvaccinated individuals with a documented primary infection. During follow-up, 7123 SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded in the BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort and 3583 reinfections were recorded in the matched natural infection cohort. 4282 SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded in the mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohort and 2301 reinfections were recorded in the matched natural infection cohort. The overall adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.47 (95% CI 0.45-0.48) after previous natural infection versus BNT162b2 vaccination, and 0.51 (0.49-0.54) after previous natural infection versus mRNA-1273 vaccination. The overall adjusted HR for severe (acute care hospitalisations), critical (intensive care unit hospitalisations), or fatal COVID-19 cases was 0.24 (0.08-0.72) after previous natural infection versus BNT162b2 vaccination, and 0.24 (0.05-1.19) after previous natural infection versus mRNA-1273 vaccination. Severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was rare in both the natural infection and vaccinated cohorts. INTERPRETATION: Previous natural infection was associated with lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of the variant, than mRNA primary-series vaccination. Vaccination remains the safest and most optimal tool for protecting against infection and COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death, irrespective of previous infection status.

While some studies were criticised due to small patient numbers and methodological limitations, they created or reinforced concerns of clinicians and people with cancer. These risks are also important in COVID-19 vaccine prioritisation decisions. We performed a systematic review to critically assess and summarise the early literature. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic search of Medline/Embase/BioRxiv/MedRxiv/SSRN databases including peer-reviewed journal articles, letters/commentaries, and non-peer-reviewed pre-print articles for 1 January-1 July 2020. The primary endpoints were diagnosis of COVID-19 and positive SARS-CoV-2 test. We assessed risk of bias using a tool adapted from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Twelve studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. All four studies of COVID-19 incidence (including 24,181,727 individuals, 125,649 with pre-existing cancer) reported that people with cancer had higher COVID-19 incidence rates. Eight studies reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity for > 472,000 individuals, 48,370 with pre-existing cancer. Seven of these studies comparing people with any and without cancer, were pooled using random effects [pooled odds ratio 0.91, 95 %CI: 0.57-1.47; unadjusted for age, sex, or comorbidities]. Two studies suggested people with active or haematological cancer had lower risk of a positive test.

METHODS: We compared the effectiveness of the three vaccines during the pre- and post-Delta variant period (before and after 1 July 2021) in a large cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Michigan Medicine healthcare system. We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) using 2 analyses: an inverse propensity weighted (IPW) Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis based on time from vaccination, and a Cox model based on calendar time with vaccination as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS: Compared to Ad26.COV2.S recipients, the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 in the post-Delta variant period was lower for BNT162b2 recipients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [.14-.98]; P = .05) and mRNA-1273 recipients (HR = 0.21; 95% CI: [.07-.64]; P = .006).

The initial two-dose vaccination schedule generates potent humoral and cellular responses, with a massive protective effect against severe COVID-19 and death. Months after this vaccination, levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 waned, and this promoted the recommendation of a third vaccination dose. METHODS: We have performed an integral and longitudinal study of the immunological responses triggered by the booster mRNA-1273 vaccination, in a cohort of health workers previously vaccinated with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine at University Hospital La Paz located in Madrid, Spain. Circulating humoral responses and SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular reactions, after ex vivo restimulation of both T and B cells (cytokines production, proliferation, class switching), have been analyzed. Importantly, all along these studies, the analyses have been performed comparing naive and subjects recovered from COVID-19, addressing the influence of a previous infection by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, as the injection of the third vaccination dose was contemporary to the rise of the Omicron BA.1 variant of concern, T- and B-cell-mediated cellular responses have been comparatively analyzed in response to this variant. RESULTS: All these analyses indicated that differential responses to vaccination due to a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were balanced following the boost. The increase in circulating humoral responses due to this booster dropped after 6 months, whereas T-cell-mediated responses were more stable along the time. Finally, all the analyzed immunological features were dampened in response to the Omicron variant of concern, particularly late after the booster vaccination. CONCLUSION: This work represents a follow-up longitudinal study for almost 1.5 years, analyzing in an integral manner the immunological responses triggered by the prime-boost mRNA-based vaccination schedule against COVID-19.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37153580/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1136029", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 2, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 34750923, "aid": "DTH15197 10.1111/dth.15197", "titl": "\"Covid arm\": Abnormal side effect after Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.", "mesh": "*2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; Arm;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Picone, Vincenzo; Martora, Fabrizio; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Marano, Laura", "jour": "Dermatologic therapy", "affl": "Dermatology Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.;;; Dermatology Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.;;; Dermatology Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.;;; Dermatology Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.", "pdat": "2022 Jan", "tiab": "\u0431\u0435\u0437 AB", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34750923/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/DTH15197 https://sci-hub.do/10.1111/dth.15197", "pt": "Comment; Letter", "pl": "United States", "topic": 4, "prop": 0.8238836377620913}, {"uid": 34865878, "aid": "S0264-410X(21)01473-0 10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.11.028", "titl": "AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCov-19): A Single-Dose biodistribution study in mice.", "mesh": "Animals;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; *ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Humans;;; Mice;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Tissue Distribution", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Stebbings, Richard; Armour, Gillian; Pettis, Vivian; Goodman, Joanne", "jour": "Vaccine", "affl": "AstraZeneca, Clinical Pharmacology & Safety Sciences, Melbourn Science Park, Melbourn SG8 6HB, United Kingdom.

The results showed a significant decrease of surrogate neutralizing antibodies against the receptor-binding domain in all VOCs in AZx2 and Mx2 but not AZ+M. A similar but minor reduction pattern of surrogate neutralizing antibodies against the extracellular domain was observed. While Mx2 exhibited a higher surrogate neutralizing level against all VOCs compared with AZx2, AZ+M showed an even higher surrogate neutralizing level in gamma and omicron compared with Mx2.

As schools have shifted from virtual to in-person learning, continual guidance is necessary to understand appropriate interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Weekly testing of students and staff for SARS-CoV-2 within K-12 school setting could provide an additional barrier to school-based transmission, especially within schools unable to implement additional mitigation strategies and/or are in areas of high transmission. This study seeks to understand the role that weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing could play in K-12 schools. In addition, through qualitative interviews and listening sessions, this research hopes to understand community concerns and barriers regarding COVID-19 testing, COVID-19 vaccine, and return to school during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS/DESIGN: Sixteen middle and high schools from five school districts have been randomized into one of the following categories: (1) Weekly screening + symptomatic testing or (2) Symptomatic testing only. The primary outcome for this study will be the average of the secondary attack rate of school-based transmission per case. School-based transmission will also be assessed through qualitative contact interviews with positive contacts identified by the school contact tracers. Lastly, new total numbers of weekly cases and contacts within a school-based quarantine will provide guidance on transmission rates. Qualitative focus groups and interviews have been conducted to provide additional understanding to the acceptance of the intervention and barriers faced by the community regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination. DISCUSSION: This study will provide greater understanding of the benefit that weekly screening testing can provide in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission within K-12 schools. Close collaboration with community partners and school districts will be necessary for the success of this and similar studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04875520 .

Rapid diagnosis, new therapeutics and effective vaccines will all be required to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantitative evaluation of serum antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 virus provides a means of monitoring a patient's immune response to a natural viral infection or vaccination, as well as evidence of a prior infection. In this paper, a portable and low-cost electrochemical immunosensor is developed for the rapid and accurate quantification of SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. The immunosensor is capable of quantifying the concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in human serum. For IgG and IgM, it provides measurements in the range of 10.1 ng/mL - 60 mug/mL and 1.64 ng/mL - 50 mug/mL, respectively, both with an assay time of 13 min.

However, data regarding prevalence of COVID-19 in children, both in Germany and internationally, are sparse. We sought to evaluate the number of infected children by measuring IgG antibodies. METHODS: Oropharyngeal swabs were collected between December 2020 and August 2021 to measure SARS-CoV-2, and capillary blood for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (by rapid test NADAL(R) and filter paper test Euroimmun(R) ELISA); venous blood was taken for validation (Roche(R) ECLIA and recomLine Blot) in 365 German children aged 3-16 years from 30 schools and preschools. We used multiple serological tests because the filter paper test Euroimmun(R) ELISA performs better in terms of sensitivity and specificity than the rapid test NADAL(R). The Roche(R) ECLIA test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the recomLine Blot test is used to rule out the possibility of infection by seasonal SARS-viruses and to test for specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins (NP, RBD and S1). In addition, one parent each (n = 336), and 4-5 teachers/caregivers (n = 90) per institution were tested for IgG antibodies from capillary blood samples. The total study duration was 4 months per child, including the first follow-up after 2 months and the second after 4 months. RESULTS: Of 364 children tested at baseline, 3.6% (n = 13) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using Euroimmun(R) ELISA. Seven children reported previously testing positive for SARS-CoV-2; each of these was confirmed by the Roche(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ECLIA (antibody to spike protein 1) test. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies persisted over a 4-month period, but levels decreased significantly (p = 0.004) within this timeframe. The median IgG values were 192.0 BAU/ml [127.2; 288.2], 123.6 BAU/ml [76.6; 187.7] and 89.9 BAU/ml [57.4; 144.2] at baseline, 2 months and 4 months after baseline, respectively. During the study period, no child tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oropharyngeal swab. A total of 4.3% of all parents and 3.7% of teachers/caregivers tested positive for IgG antibodies by Euroimmun(R) ELISA at baseline. CONCLUSION: We noted a rather low seroprevalence in children despite an under-reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Measurement of IgG antibodies derived from capillary blood appears to be a valid tool to detect asymptomatic infections in children. However, no asymptomatic active infection was detected during the study period of 4 months in the whole cohort. Further data on SARS-CoV-2 infections in children are needed, especially in the group of <5-year-olds, as there is currently no licensed vaccine for this age group in Germany.

Currently, there are no standard remedies or therapies for COVID-19. it is important to identify and diagnose COVID-19 to control the spread.

We established a bunch of triplex new TaqMan real-time PCR assays. Three sets of primers and probes (targeting the ORF1ab, N, and E genes, respectively) are poorly consistent with other human coronaviruses and the human influenza virus. The sensitivity of established PCR assays notices as few as 100 copies per PCR of the ORF1ab, N, and E genes. Meanwhile, standard curves concluded from constant PCR reaction all showed glorious linear correlations between Ct values and the polymer loading copy variety (correlation coefficient (R(2) ) of ORF1ab, N, and E genes is 0.996, 0.991, and 0.998, respectively).

Standardization will allow comparison of results across various lab-developed and commercial assays and publications. SARS-CoV-2 EURM-017 is human sera reference material containing antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 proteins, S1/S2 (full-length spike [S]), S1 receptor-binding domain (S1 RBD), S1, S2, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The goal of this study was to characterize five antigen-specific serum fractions in EURM-017 for standardization of serology assays. METHODS: Five antigen-specific serum fractions were affinity purified, quantified, and PRNT(50) titers compared. Standardization methods were established for two anti-S1 RBD (IgG and Total Ig) and one N protein assay. For the anti-S1 RBD assays, standardization involved determining assay index values for serial dilutions of S1-RBD anti-sera. Index values for the anti-S1 RBD IgG assay and PRNT(50) titers were determined for 44 symptomatic COVID-19 patient sera. The index values were converted to EURM-017 ug/mL. RESULTS: Anti-sera protein content was as follows: S1 (17.7 microg/mL), S1 RBD (17.4 microg/mL), S1/S2 (full-length S) (34.1 microg/mL), S2 (29.7 microg/mL), and N protein (72.5 microg/mL). S1 anti-serum had the highest neutralization activity. A standardization method for S1 RBD anti-serum and an anti-S1 RBD IgG assay yielded the linear equation (y = 0.75x-0.10; y = index, x=microg/mL anti-serum). Patient sample index values for the S1-RBD IgG assay correlated well with PRNT(50) titers (Pearson r = 0.84). Using the equation above, patient index values were converted to standardized microg/mL.

The following conditions were found to be optimal for such amplification: 1) 70 mul reaction volume, 2) the supply of external temperature 145 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic for the denaturation zone and 0 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic for the annealing zone, 3)  approximately 30 degrees inclination of the microtube main axis, 4) the use of nearby primers, and 5) duration of the reaction 15-20 min. At these conditions, the amplification products are accumulated in an amount sufficient to be registered by gel electrophoresis, and high sensitivity of the reaction comparable to that of conventional PCR is achieved. cPCR provided the reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35074320/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0003-2697(22)00020-3 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.ab.2022.114565", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35746653, "aid": "v14061181 viruses-14-01181 10.3390/v14061181", "titl": "Vaccination with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Induces Cross-Reactive Anti-RBD IgG against SARS-CoV-2 Variants including Omicron.", "mesh": "Antibodies, Viral;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Humans;;; Immunoglobulin G;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/genetics;;; Vaccination", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Gerges, Daniela; Kapps, Sebastian; Hernandez-Carralero, Esperanza; Freire, Raimundo; Aiad, Monika; Schmidt, Sophie; Winnicki, Wolfgang; Reiter, Thomas; Pajenda, Sahra; Schmidt, Alice; Sunder-Plassmann, Gere; Wagner, Ludwig", "jour": "Viruses", "affl": "Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.;;; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.;;; Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital Universitario de Canarias-FIISC, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.;;; Instituto de Tecnologias Biomedicas, Universidad de La Laguna, 38200 La Laguna, Spain.;;; Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital Universitario de Canarias-FIISC, 38320 La Laguna, Spain.;;; Instituto de Tecnologias Biomedicas, Universidad de La Laguna, 38200 La Laguna, Spain.;;; Universidad Fernando Pessoa Canarias, 35450 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.;;; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.;;; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.;;; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.;;; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.;;; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.;;; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.;;; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.;;; Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.", "pdat": "2022 May 28", "tiab": "SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have caused a significant increase in infections worldwide.

Pre-pandemic cross-reactive anti-Omicron IgG was detected in 31 individuals and was increased 8.78-fold after vaccination, regardless of vaccine type.

To capture the prevalence in an accurate and timely manner and to understand the mode of nosocomial infection are essential for its preventive measure. METHODS: We recruited 685 healthcare workers (HCW's) at Tokyo Shinagawa Hospital prior to the vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine. Sera of the subjects were tested by assays for the titer of IgG against S protein's receptor binding domain (IgG (RBD)) or IgG against nucleocapsid protein (IgG (N)) of SARS-CoV-2. Together with PCR data, the positive rates by these methods were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall positive rates among HCW's by PCR, IgG (RBD), IgG (N) with a cut-off of 1.4 S/C (IgG (N)1.4), and IgG (N) with a cut-off of 0.2 S/C (IgG (N)0.2) were 3.5%, 9.5%, 6.1%, and 27.7%, respectively. Positive rates of HCW's working in COVID-19 ward were significantly higher than those of HCW's working in non-COVID-19 ward by all the four methods. Concordances of IgG (RBD), IgG (N)1.4, and IgG (N)0.2 against PCR were 97.1%, 71.4%, and 88.6%, respectively. By subtracting the positive rates of PCR from that of IgG (RBD), the rate of overall silent infection and that of HCW's in COVID-19 ward were estimated to be 6.0% and 21.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For the prevention of nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2, identification of silent infection is essential. For the detection of ongoing infection, periodical screening with IgG (RBD) in addition to PCR would be an effective measure. For the surveillance of morbidity in the population, on the other hand, IgG (N)0.2 could be the most reliable indicator among the three serological tests.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35594509/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/PONE-D-21-39516 https://sci-hub.do/10.1371/journal.pone.0267566", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 5, "prop": 0.610298187270219}, {"uid": 35881018, "aid": "abn9237 10.1126/scitranslmed.abn9237", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination elicits robust antibody responses in children.", "mesh": "Child;;; Humans;;; 2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; Antibodies, Viral;;; *Antibody Formation;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology;;; Receptors, Fc;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccination", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Bartsch, Yannic C; St Denis, Kerri J; Kaplonek, Paulina; Kang, Jaewon; Lam, Evan C; Burns, Madeleine D; Farkas, Eva J; Davis, Jameson P; Boribong, Brittany P; Edlow, Andrea G; Fasano, Alessio; Shreffler, Wayne G; Zavadska, Dace; Johnson, Marina; Goldblatt, David; Balazs, Alejandro B; Yonker, Lael M; Alter, Galit", "jour": "Science translational medicine", "affl": "Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.;;; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.;;; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.;;; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.;;; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.;;; Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Pediatrics, Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Boston, MA 02114, USA.;;; Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Pediatrics, Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Boston, MA 02114, USA.;;; Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Pediatrics, Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Boston, MA 02114, USA.;;; Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Pediatrics, Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Boston, MA 02114, USA.;;; Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology, Boston, MA 02114, USA.;;; Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Pediatrics, Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Boston, MA 02114, USA.;;; Massachusetts General Hospital Food Allergy Center, Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Boston, MA 02114, USA.;;; Children's Clinical University Hospital, Riga, LV-1004, Latvia.;;; Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health Biomedical Research Centre, University College London, London WC1N 1EH, UK.;;; Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health Biomedical Research Centre, University College London, London WC1N 1EH, UK.;;; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.;;; Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Pediatrics, Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center, Boston, MA 02114, USA.;;; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Nov 23", "tiab": "Although children have been largely spared from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) with increased transmissibility, combined with fluctuating mask mandates and school reopenings, has led to increased infections and disease among children. Thus, there is an urgent need to roll out COVID-19 vaccines to children of all ages. However, whether children respond equivalently to adults to mRNA vaccines and whether dosing will elicit optimal immunity remain unclear. Here, we aimed to deeply profile the vaccine-induced humoral immune response in 6- to 11-year-old children receiving either a pediatric (50 mug) or adult (100 mug) dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine and to compare these responses to vaccinated adults, infected children, and children who experienced multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Children elicited an IgG-dominant vaccine-induced immune response, surpassing adults at a matched 100-mug dose but more variable immunity at a 50-mug dose. Irrespective of titer, children generated antibodies with enhanced Fc receptor binding capacity. Moreover, like adults, children generated cross-VOC humoral immunity, marked by a decline of omicron-specific receptor binding domain, but robustly preserved omicron spike protein binding. Fc receptor binding capabilities were also preserved in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that both the 50- and 100-mug doses of mRNA vaccination in children elicit robust cross-VOC antibody responses and that 100-mug doses in children result in highly preserved omicron-specific functional humoral immunity.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35881018/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/abn9237 https://sci-hub.do/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn9237", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.8685784897402911}, {"uid": 35149235, "aid": "S2666-9919(22)00035-5 10.1016/j.idnow.2022.02.002", "titl": "3D-printed simulator for nasopharyngeal swab collection for COVID-19.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing/instrumentation/*methods;;; Humans;;; Nasopharynx;;; *Printing, Three-Dimensional;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Koch, A; Vermel, M; Hansmann, Y; Lodi, M; Mura, C; Sananes, A; Gallien, S; Wurtz, E; Bleibtreu, A; Martinot, M; Exinger, J; Lescure, X; Kerneis, S; Lacombe, K; Mootien, J Y; Shawali, C; Lecointre, L; Debry, C; Lefebvre, N; Sananes, N", "jour": "Infectious diseases now", "affl": "Obstetrics department, Strasbourg university hospital, Strasbourg, France.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Simulator training sessions were carried out in 11 centers in France. A questionnaire assessing the simulator was administered at the end of the sessions. The study population included both healthcare workers (HCW) and volunteers from the general population. RESULTS: Out of 589 participants, overall satisfaction was scored 9.0 [8.9-9.1] on a scale of 0 to 10 with excellent results in the 16 evaluation items of each category (HCWs and general population, NPS novices and experienced). The simulator was considered very realistic (95%), easy to use (97%), useful to understand the anatomy (89%) and NPS sampling technique (93%). This educational tool was considered essential (93%). Participants felt their future NPS would be more reliable (72%), less painful (70%), easier to perform (88%) and that they would be carried out more serenely (90%). The mean number of NPS conducted on the simulator to feel at ease was two; technical fluency with the simulator can thus be acquired quickly. CONCLUSION: Our simulator, whose 3D printing can be reproduced freely using a permanent open access link, is an essential educational tool to standardize the learning and improvement of NPS collection.

Some of the key issues currently include incorrect and/or inconsistent use of face masks, low acceptance of early screening or vaccination for COVID-19, vaccine hesitance, and misinformation. This is particularly the case in some vulnerable populations, such as older people with chronic illnesses, ethnic minorities who may not speak the mainstream language well and children. The current protocol introduces a large programme of research through five interrelated studies that all focus on social and behavioural interventions to improve different aspects of community-related preventative indicators. Hence, the specific objectives of the overall programme are to (1) increase early testing for COVID-19 and promote the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in the community (Study 1); (2) increase COVID-19-related health literacy and vaccine literacy and promote improved preventative measures in minority ethnic groups, chronically ill populations and caregivers (Study 2); (3) strengthen the public's motivation to stay at home and avoid nonessential high-risk activities (Study 3); (4) decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (Study 4); and (5) enhance the adherence to COVID-19-related hygiene practices and the uptake of early testing in school children (Study 5). METHODS: We will utilise a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in the proposed studies. All studies will incorporate an intervention development phase in conjunction with key community stakeholders, a feasibility study and an execution stage. A variety of self-reported and objective-based measures will be used to assess various outcomes, based on the focus of each study, in both the short- and long-term, including, for example, the 8-item self-reported eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEAL) and objective measures such as vaccine uptake. DISCUSSION: Theory-driven interventions will address each study's focus (e.g., social distancing, promotion of vaccine uptake, eHealth education, preventive measures and early detection). Improvements are expected to be seen in the outcomes of vulnerable and high-risk groups. Decreased infection rates are expected due to improved preventative behaviours and increased vaccine uptake. Long-term sustainability of the approach will be achieved through the CBPR model. The publication of this protocol can assist not only in sharing a large-scale and complex community-based design, but will also allow all to learn from this, so that we will have better insight in the future whether sharing of study designs can elicit timely research initiatives.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36293972/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/ijerph192013392 https://sci-hub.do/ijerph-19-13392 https://sci-hub.do/10.3390/ijerph192013392", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 35151852, "aid": "S1201-9712(22)00091-1 10.1016/j.ijid.2022.02.015", "titl": "Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among previously infected or vaccinated employees.", "mesh": "Adult;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; Incidence;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Kojima, N; Roshani, A; Brobeck, M; Baca, A; Klausner, J D", "jour": "International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases", "affl": "Department of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, 90095.

METHODS: In March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 testing company began routinely screening its workforce for SARS-CoV-2 with a PCR test. On December 15, 2020, vaccination with either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines became available. Routine screening has continued through July 2021. We compared the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection between people who were SARS-CoV-2 naive and unvaccinated, people with prior COVID-19 without vaccination, and people vaccinated without prior COVID-19. Incidence in 100 person-years with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) was calculated with the Poisson Exact equation. The incidence rate ratio (IRR), the ratio of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100 person-years of follow-up with 95% CIs, was used as a measure of association between groups. Analyses were performed on StataSE. RESULTS: The median age of employees was 29.0 years (interquartile range: 23.6, 39.9). During the observation period, 258 SARS-CoV-2 incident infections were identified. The naive, unvaccinated group had a SARS-CoV-2 incidence of 25.9 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 22.8-29.3). The previously infected, unvaccinated group had an incidence of 0 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0-5.0). The vaccinated group had an incidence of 1.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.04-4.2). CONCLUSION: We found a strong association between prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 with either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines and the reduced incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with those naive and/or unvaccinated to SARS-CoV-2.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35151852/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S1201-9712(22)00091-1 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.ijid.2022.02.015", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Canada", "topic": 3, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35173731, "aid": "10.3389/fimmu.2022.821218", "titl": "Identifying COVID-19 Infections From a Vaccinated Population Using Specific IgA Antibody Test.", "mesh": "Antibodies, Viral/*blood;;;

METHODS: We recruited adult volunteers for homologous or heterologous prime-boost vaccinations with adenoviral (ChAdOx1, AstraZeneca) and/or mRNA (mRNA-1273, Moderna) vaccines. Four groups of prime-boost vaccination schedules were designed: Group 1, ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1 8 weeks apart; Group 2, ChAdOx1/mRNA-1273 8 weeks apart; Group 3, ChAdOx1/mRNA-1273 4 weeks apart; and Group 4, mRNA-1273/mRNA-1273 4 weeks apart. The primary outcome was serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers and neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants on day 28 after the second dose. Adverse events were recorded up until 84 days after the second dose. RESULTS: We enrolled 399 participants with a median age of 41 years and 75% were female. On day 28 after the second dose, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers of both heterologous vaccinations (Group 2 and Group 3) were significantly higher than that of homologous ChAdOx1 vaccination (Group 1), and comparable with homologous mRNA-1273 vaccination (Group 4). The heterologous vaccination group had better neutralizing antibody responses against the alpha and delta variant as compared to the homologous ChAdOx1 group. Most of the adverse events (AEs) were mild and transient. AEs were less frequent when heterologous boosting was done at 8 weeks rather than at 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Heterologous ChAdOx1/mRNA-1273 vaccination provided higher immunogenicity than homologous ChAdOx1 vaccination and comparable immunogenicity with the homologous mRNA-1273 vaccination. Our results support the safety and efficacy of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using the ChAdOx1 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines.

In the past 2 years, several variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), such as the Delta and Omicron variants, have emerged with higher transmissibility, immune evasion and drug resistance, leading to higher morbidity and mortality in the population. The prevalent variants of concern (VOCs) share several mutations on the spike that can affect virus characteristics, including transmissibility, antigenicity, and immune evasion. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the neutralization capacity of sera from COVID-19 convalescent or vaccinated individuals is decreased against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Moreover, the vaccine effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs is not as high as that against wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, more attention might be paid to how the mutations impact vaccine effectiveness.

In this context, patients after organ transplantation are especially endangered because of their increased susceptibility to infections. Real effectiveness of vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 and exposition to the virus in populations after organ transplantation is still being assessed. METHODS: We investigated 371 adult patients (82.7% men, 17.3% women), aged 54 +/- 14 years, with a median time from transplantation of 1296 days (interquartile range, 473-400 days) after orthotopic heart transplantation consecutively admitted to the transplant center between February and September 2021. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies were assessed quantitatively by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S. Data according to past COVID-19 infection and vaccination were compared with the test results. Among the whole group, 59 patients were unvaccinated and had no past COVID-19 infection, 200 patients had a full course of vaccination (2 doses) with an mRNA vaccine, 1 patient had received a viral vector vaccine, 11 patients had had a single dose of an mRNA vaccine, and 99 patients had previously had a COVID-19 infection. Median time from vaccination to antibody assessment was 54 days (interquartile range, 30-76 days). AIM: The aim of this study was to determine exposure to the virus among patients after heart transplantation before vaccination and humoral response to the vaccination and assess the role of antispike antibodies in the prevention of infection. RESULTS: After vaccination, 22.3% had no antibodies (45 patients), 47.3% had titers between 0.8 U/mL [0.82 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL] and 250 U/mL (257.25 BAU/mL; 95 patients), and 30.2% had titers above 250 U/mL (257.25 BAU/mL; 61 patients). After a single dose of vaccine, 63% patients had no antibodies. In the group of unvaccinated patients, 3 patients had titers above 250 U/mL (257.25 BAU/mL; 5.1%) and 12 patients had titers up to 250 U/mL (257.25 BAU/mL; 20.3%). In patients after COVID-19 infection, only 2% did not show antispike antibodies, and in 61.4% the titers were above 250 U/mL (257.25 BAU/mL). In the group of patients infected after the full course of vaccination (4 patients after a single dose and 2 after 2 doses), none of the patients developed antibodies after vaccination. Up to the end of September 2021, none of the patients with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 developed COVID-19.

Compared with traditional detection techniques, optical biosensors based on nanomaterials/nanostructures have received much interest in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 due to the high sensitivity, high accuracy, and fast response. In this review, the research progress on optical biosensors in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, including fluorescence biosensors, colorimetric biosensors, Surface Enhancement Raman Scattering (SERS) biosensors, and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensors, was comprehensively summarized.

The results of the phase 3 trial have shown clinical efficacy of BBV152. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative, case-control study among employees of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India), who had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and had an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the peak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India between April 15 and May 15, 2021. Cases (test-positives) and controls (test-negatives) were matched (1:1) on the basis of age and gender. The odds of vaccination with BBV152 were compared between cases and controls and adjusted for level of occupational exposure (to COVID-19), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and calendar time, using conditional logistic regression. The primary outcome was effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 (with the second dose received at least 14 days before testing) in reducing the odds of symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, expressed as (1 - odds ratio) x 100%. FINDINGS: Between April 15 and May 15, 2021, 3732 individuals had an RT-PCR test. Of these, 2714 symptomatic employees had data on vaccination status, and 1068 matched case-control pairs were available for analysis. The adjusted effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 50% (95% CI 33-62; p<0.0001). The adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 28 days before testing was 46% (95% CI 22-62) and administered at least 42 days before testing was 57% (21-76). After excluding participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, the adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 47% (95% CI 29-61). INTERPRETATION: This study shows the effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 in the context of a huge surge in cases, presumably dominated by the potentially immune-evasive delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support the ongoing roll-out of this vaccine to help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, while continuing the emphasis on adherence to non-pharmacological measures. FUNDING: None.

METHODS: A total of 694 sera were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies: 407 uninfected, 201 symptomatic subjects, 37 post-infection patients, and 49 vaccinated. Sixty-eight of the previous sera were used to compare the Chorus SARS-CoV-2 \"Neutralizing\" Ab results with those obtained with micro-neutralization of the Alpha and original variants. A set of 74 positive sera for other respiratory infections were analyzed to evaluate the possible cross reaction to SARS-CoV-2 virus. RESULTS: Of the 694 samples, only 3 had discordant results between micro-neutralization and values measured by Chorus SARS-CoV-2 \"Neutralizing\" Ab: 1 false negative and 2 false positives. Values of sensitivity and specificity were very high: percent positive agreement (sensitivity) 99.6% (95% CI: 97.7 - 99.9) and percent negative agreement (specificity) 99.6% (95% CI: 98.0 -99.9).

Patients self-reported vaccination status at the time of testing. We used a test-negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) by comparing odds of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated (n = 474,805), partially vaccinated (n = 87,834), and unvaccinated (n = 369,333) patients, adjusted for demographic factors and calendar time. RESULTS: VE against symptomatic infection after 2 doses of mRNA vaccine was 96% (95% Confidence Interval: 95%, 97%) in the pre-delta period and reduced to 79% (95% CI: 77%, 81%) in the delta period.

Field deployable non-invasive sensitive diagnostic techniques are needed to evaluate the infectivity dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric populations and guide public health interventions, particularly if this population is not fully vaccinated. We evaluated the utility of high-throughput Luminex assays to quantify saliva IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against five SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens in a contacts and infectivity longitudinal study in 122 individuals (52 children and 70 adults). We compared saliva versus serum/plasma samples in infected children and adults diagnosed by weekly RT-PCR over 35 days (n=62), and those who consistently tested negative over the same follow up period (n=60), in the Summer of 2020 in Barcelona, Spain. Saliva antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals were significantly higher than in negative individuals and correlated with those measured in sera/plasmas. Asymptomatic infected individuals had higher levels of anti-S IgG than symptomatic individuals, suggesting a protective anti-disease role for antibodies. Higher anti-S IgG and IgM levels in serum/plasma and saliva, respectively, in infected children compared to infected adults could also be related to stronger clinical immunity in them. Among infected children, males had higher levels of saliva IgG to N and RBD than females. Despite overall correlation, individual clustering analysis suggested that responses that may not be detected in blood could be patent in saliva, and vice versa. In conclusion, measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific saliva antibodies should be considered as a complementary non-invasive assay to serum/plasma to determine COVID-19 prevalence and transmission in pediatric populations before and after vaccination campaigns.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35154094/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fimmu.2022.751705", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 9, "prop": 0.8875937167403399}, {"uid": 34883487, "aid": "000521408 mpp-0094-0025 10.1159/000521408", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2 Clinical Characteristics and Viral Shedding in Kuwait.", "mesh": "Adult;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;;; Female;;; Hospitalization;;; Humans;;; Kuwait/epidemiology;;; Male;;; Middle Aged;;; Nasopharynx/*virology;;; Oropharynx/*virology;;; Respiratory Distress Syndrome;;; Retrospective Studies;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics/isolation & purification;;; *Virus Shedding", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Alghounaim, Mohammad; Caya, Chelsea; Alothman, Khalid; Alhasawi, Almonther; Papenburg, Jesse", "jour": "Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre", "affl": "Department of Pediatrics, Amiri Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait, Kuwait.;;; McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.;;; Department of Pediatrics, Jaber Alahmad Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait, Kuwait.;;; Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait, Kuwait.;;; Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, The Montreal Children's Hospital, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.;;; Division of Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.", "pdat": "2022", "tiab": "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and estimate viral shedding duration in respiratory specimens.

In this longitudinal prospective study (January 21-October 30, 2021), 90 naive and 15 convalescent individuals were enrolled at the initiation of vaccination. Samples from 27 unvaccinated individuals with previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were collected at a single time point. Longitudinal serology profile (antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] S and N proteins) and live-virus-based neutralization capacities were assessed while controlling for age. Sex, age, history of reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine, and viral neutralization capacities were identified as significant risk factors for breakthrough COVID-19.

Vaccine boosting remarkably increased these viral neutralization capacities by 16.22-fold (p- value = 0.0005), supporting the importance of the BNT162b2 booster in efforts to control the incursion of future variants into the population at large. Strikingly, BC19 cases exhibited a delayed/absent antibody response to the N protein, suggesting limited exposure to the virus.

Real-time RT-PCR assays detect non-viable virus, and cell culture differentiates viable virus but it takes several weeks and is labour-intensive. Subgenomic RNAs may reflect replication-competent virus. We therefore evaluated the usefulness of subgenomic RNAs for diagnosing viable SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with various severities of confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled at a tertiary hospital between February and December 2020. RT-PCR assay results for genomic and subgenomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab, sputum and saliva specimens were compared with cell culture results. RESULTS: A total 189 specimens from 20 COVID-19 patients were tested in genomic and subgenomic PCR assays and cultured on Vero cells. Of these 189 samples, 62 (33%) gave positive culture results, 93 (49%) negative results and the remaining 34 (18%) indeterminate results.

Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has emerged as a promising diagnostic platform for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, in part because it can be performed with simple instrumentation. However, isothermal amplification methods frequently yield spurious amplicons even in the absence of a template. Consequently, RT-LAMP assays can produce false positive results when they are based on generic intercalating dyes or pH-sensitive indicators. Here, we report the development of a sensitive RT-LAMP assay that leverages on a novel sequence-specific probe to guard against spurious amplicons. We show that our optimized fluorescent assay, termed LANTERN, takes only 30 min to complete and can be applied directly on swab or saliva samples. Furthermore, utilizing clinical RNA samples from 52 patients with COVID-19 infection and 21 healthy individuals, we demonstrate that our diagnostic test exhibits a specificity and positive predictive value of 95% with a sensitivity of 8 copies per reaction.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the challenge with this method is that it is expensive, which has resulted in under-testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in many LMICs. Hence, this study aimed to compare and evaluate alternative methods for the mass testing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in laboratories with limited resources to identify cost-effective, faster, and accurate alternatives to the internationally approved kits. A total of 50 residual nasopharyngeal swab samples were used for evaluation and comparison between internationally approved kits (Thermo Fisher PureLink RNA Isolation Kit and Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 Assay Kit) and alternative methods (three RNA extraction and four commercial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay kits) in terms of the cost analysis, diagnostic accuracy, and turnaround time. In terms of performance, all of the alternative RNA extraction methods evaluated were comparable to the internationally approved kits but were more cost-effective (Lucigen QuickExtract RNA Extraction Kit, Bosphore EX-Tract Dry Swab RNA Solution and Sonicator method) and four commercial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay kits (Nucleic Acid COVID-19 Test Kit (SARS-CoV-2), abTES(TM) COVID-19 qPCR I Kit, PCL COVID19 Speedy RT-PCR Kit, and PCLMD nCoV One-Step RT-PCR Kit) with a sensitivity range of 76-100% and specificity of 96-100%. The cost per sample was reduced by more than 50% when compared to internationally approved kits. When compared to the Thermo Fisher PureLink Kit and Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 Assay Kit, the alternative methods had a faster turnaround time, indicating that laboratories with limited resources may be able to process more samples in a day. The above-mentioned cost-effective, fast, and accurate evaluated alternative methods can be used in routine diagnostic laboratories with limited resources for mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 because these were comparable to the internationally approved kits, Thermo Fisher PureLink Kit and Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 Assay Kit.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolated plasma from 95 volunteers' blood samples was used to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular immune responses. Positive controls were recovered patients from COVID-19 (unvaccinated). Specific quantification kits for anti-nucleocapsid IgG, anti-Spike protein IgG, neutralizing antibodies as well as specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens for T-cell activation were used and Spearman correlation and matrix analyses were performed to compare overall immune responses. RESULTS: Nucleocapsid antibodies were significantly higher for the BBIBP-CorV and convalescent group when compared to other vaccines. In contrast, subjects vaccinated with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 presented significantly higher anti-spike IgG. In fact, 9.1% of convalescent, 4.5% of Gam-COVID-Vac, 28.6% of ChAdOx1, and 12.5% of BBIBP-CorV volunteers did not generate anti-spike IgG. Similarly, a positive correlation was observed after the neutralization assay. T-cell activation studies showed that mRNA-based vaccines induced a T-cell driven immune response in all cases, while 55% of convalescents,  8% of BNT162b1,  12,5% of mRNA-1273, 9% of Gam-COVID-Vac,  57% of ChAdOx1,  and  56% of BBIBP-CorV subjects presented no cellular response. Further correlation matrix analyses indicated that anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies production, and T-cell activation follow the same trend after immunization. CONCLUSIONS: RNA-based vaccines induced the most robust adaptive immune activation against SARS-CoV-2 by promoting a significantly higher T-cell response, anti-spike IgG and neutralization levels.

We investigated the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the incidence of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The study design was an observational data linkage cohort study. Multiple health care datasets were linked to ascertain all SARS-CoV-2 testing, vaccination, hospitalization, and mortality data for all patients treated with KRT in Scotland from the start of the pandemic over a period of 20 months. Descriptive statistics, survival analyses, and vaccine effectiveness were calculated. RESULTS: As of September 19, 2021, 93% (n=5281) of the established KRT population in Scotland had received two doses of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Over the study period, there were 814 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (15.1% of the KRT population). Vaccine effectiveness rates against infection and hospitalization were 33% (95% CI, 0 to 52) and 38% (95% CI, 0 to 57), respectively. Within 28 days of a SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR test, 9.2% of fully vaccinated individuals died (7% patients on dialysis and 10% kidney transplant recipients).

Vaccines may substantially reduce these risks, but evidence is needed on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness for incarcerated people, who are confined in large, risky congregate settings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate effectiveness of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), against confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections among incarcerated people in California prisons from 22 December 2020 through 1 March 2021. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provided daily data for all prison residents including demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics, as well as COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and outcomes. We estimated vaccine effectiveness using multivariable Cox models with time-varying covariates, adjusted for resident characteristics and infection rates across prisons. RESULTS: Among 60 707 cohort members, 49% received at least 1 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 dose during the study period. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64%-82%) from day 14 after first dose until receipt of second dose and 97% (95% CI, 88%-99%) from day 14 after second dose. Effectiveness was similar among the subset of residents who were medically vulnerable: 74% (95% CI, 62%-82%) and 92% (95% CI, 74%-98%) from 14 days after first and second doses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with results from randomized trials and observational studies in other populations, mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people.

It is one of the most mutating virus in the world. These mutations are responsible for the appearance of new variants, the most recent of which is Omicron (line B.1.1.529). This new variant was first identified in South Africa in November 2021. The main fear with this variant is that of an immune escape and ineffectiveness of vaccines currently available. OBJECTIVE: We studied the response of our immune system and the effectiveness of current vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC. METHODS: We carried out a narrative review from 32 scientific articles from databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, BioRxiv and MedRxiv. RESULTS: Faced with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC: The humoral immune response decreased, while the cellular immune response was preserved. The booster vaccine provided protection against symptomatic or non-symptomatic infections, transmission, and serious forms. CONCLUSION: In the end, according to these data, the 3rd dose appears to be the solution to be able to defeat SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC.

METHODS: We retrospectively compared protection against symptomatic infection conferred by mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 at Mayo Clinic sites from December 2020 to September 2021. We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) and to compare the odds of symptomatic infection after full vaccination with mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2, while adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, geography, comorbidities, and calendar time of vaccination and testing. FINDINGS: Both vaccines were highly effective over the study duration (VE(mRNA-1273): 84.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 81.6%-86.2%; VE(BNT162b2): 75.6%, 95% CI: 72.2%-78.7%), but their effectiveness was reduced during July-September (VE(mRNA-1273): 75.6%, 95% CI: 70.1%-80%; VE(BNT162b2): 63.5%, 95% CI: 55.8%-69.9%) as compared to December-May (VE(mRNA-1273): 93.7%, 95% CI: 90.4%-95.9%; VE(BNT162b2): 85.7%, 95% CI: 81.4%-88.9%).

Immune responses were evaluated in a prespecified, randomly selected per-protocol immunogenicity population (n = 272 placebo; n = 1185 mRNA-1273). Serum binding antibodies (bAbs) and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-spike protein were assessed at days 1, 29, and 57 by baseline SARS-CoV-2-negative (n = 1197) and SARS-CoV-2-positive (n = 260) status, age, and sex. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-negative vaccinees had bAb geometric mean AU/mL levels of 35 753 at day 29 that increased to 316 448 at day 57 and nAb inhibitory dilution 50% titers of 55 at day 29 that rose to 1081 at day 57. In SARS-CoV-2-positive vacinees, the first mRNA-1273 injection elicited bAb and nAb levels that were 11-fold (410 049) and 27-fold (1479) higher than in SARS-CoV-2-negative vaccinees, respectively, and were comparable to levels after 2 injections in uninfected participants. Findings were generally consistent by age and sex.

We compared subgroups based on vaccination status, and between models that excluded prior infections 3 to 12 months before sample collection. Of 1119 participants, 914 (81.7%) were vaccinated and 60 (5.4%) had evidence of a preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall and within vaccinated and unvaccinated subgroups, the optimal thresholds were 828 AU/mL, 827 AU/mL, and 1324 AU/mL; with sensitivities of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.96), 0.95 (0.94 to 0.96), 0.94 (0.92 to 0.96) and specificities of 0.88 (0.86 to 0.90), 0.87 (0.85 to 0.89), and 0.94 (0.89 to 0.98), respectively.

Booster vaccination of individuals can improve waning immunity and reduce the impact of community epidemics. METHODS: Using an epidemiological model that incorporates population-level severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and waning of vaccine-derived immunity, we identify the hypothetical potential of mass vaccination with fractionated vaccine doses specific to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222 [Covishield]; AstraZeneca) as an optimal and cost-effective strategy in India's Omicron outbreak. FINDINGS: We find that the optimal strategy is 1/8 fractional dosing under mild (Re  approximately  1.2) and rapid (Re  approximately  5) transmission scenarios, leading to an estimated $6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -13, 26) billion and $2 (95% CI: -26, 30) billion in health-related net monetary benefit over 200 days, respectively. Rapid and broad use of fractional dosing for boosters, together with delivery costs divided by fractionation, could substantially gain more net monetary benefit by $11 (95% CI: -10, 33) and $2 (95% CI: -23, 28) billion, respectively, under the mild and rapid transmission scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Mass vaccination with fractional doses of COVID-19 vaccines to boost immunity in a vaccinated population could be a cost-effective strategy for mitigating the public health costs of resurgences caused by vaccine-evasive variants, and fractional dosing deserves further clinical and regulatory evaluation.

However, the performance of RADT in vaccinated individuals has not been fully investigated. OBJECTIVES: RT-qPCR and rapid antigen detection testing were performed to evaluate the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test in detecting SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. STUDY DESIGN: Two swab specimens, one for RT-qPCR and one for RADT, were collected from vaccinated individuals in an outpatient clinic. For comparison of RADT performance in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, a dataset already published by this group was used as reference. RESULTS: During the delta wave, a total of 696 samples were tested with both RT-qPCR and RADT that included 692 (99.4%) samples from vaccinated individuals. Of these, 76 (11.0%) samples were detected SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-qPCR and 45 (6.5%) samples by the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test. Stratified by Ct values, sensitivity of the RADT was 100.0%, 94.4% and 81.1% for Ct </= 20 (n=18), Ct </= 25 (n=36) and Ct </= 30 (n=53), respectively. Samples with Ct values >/= 30 (n=23) were not detected. Overall RADT specificity was 99.7% and symptom status did not affect RADT performance.

METHODS: We included 1733 samples from 375 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals of the North Zealand Covid-19 Cohort in an 8-month period. We investigated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity against consensus and PCR and interassay agreement over time for 5 SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays [Roche-nucleocapsid (NC)-total, Roche-receptor binding domain (RBD)-total, Siemens-RBD-IgG, Siemens-RBD-total, Thermo Fisher Scientific (TFS)-RBD-IgG] commercially available on automated platforms and 2 ELISA assays (TFS-RBD-total, Wantai-RBD-total). RESULTS: Early interassay discrepancy in up to 49% of samples decreased steadily during the first 18 days. By day 18, all assays had reached a plateau between 82.3% and 90.5% seropositivity compared to PCR. Assays ranked by closest agreement with the consensus model beyond day 18 (sensitivity/specificity against consensus) were as follows: Roche-RBD-total, 99.8%/100.0%; Wantai-RBD-total, 99.8%/99.7%; Roche-NC-total, 97.8%/100.0%; Siemens-RBD-total, 98.0%/98.7%; TFS-RBD-total, 96.9%/99.7%; TFS-RBD-IgG, 91.5%/100.0%; and Siemens-RBD-IgG, 94.6%/89.9%. We found that 7.8% of PCR-positive patients remained seronegative in all assays throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: All included assays had sensitivities against consensus >90% past day 18. For the current recommended use of antibody assays to detect former, undocumented Covid-19, our data suggest the use of total antibody assays rather than IgG-specific assays due to higher long-term sensitivity.

METHODS: The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in corneal rims and conjunctival tissues from 100 donors who were found suitable for transplantation as per the donor screening guidelines of the Global Alliance of Eye Bank Associations. The donor's clinical history and cause of death were assessed for secondary analysis. RESULTS: Of 200 ocular tissues (100 corneal and 100 conjunctival) from the same 1 eye of 100 surgical-intended donors, between September 2020 and April 2021, the overall positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 was  approximately 1% (2/200). Both the ocular samples that tested positive were conjunctival biopsies (2/100, 2%), whereas corneal samples were negative (0/100, 0%) in both donors. The causes of donor death were trauma in 51 donors, suicide in 33, cardiac arrest in 7, electric shock in 5, metabolic cause in 2, malignancy in 1, and snake bite in 1. None of the donors had a medical history suggestive of COVID infection or possible contact. None of the recipients from the donors were reported to have any systemic adverse event after keratoplasty until the follow-up of 6 weeks.

We evaluated a novel Beanguard gargle (BG)-based virus collection method that can be applied to Ag-RDT as an alternative to the current RT-PCR with an NPS for early diagnosis of COVID-19. This clinical trial comprised 102 COVID-19-positive patients hospitalized after a governmental screening process and 100 healthy individuals. Paired NPS and BG-based saliva specimens from COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals were analyzed using NPS-RT-PCR, BG-RT-PCR, and BG-Ag-RDTs, whose diagnostic performance for detecting SARS-CoV-2 was compared. BG-Ag-RDTs showed high sensitivity (97.8%) and specificity (100%) in 45 patients within 6 days of illness and detected all cases of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants. In 11 asymptomatic active COVID-19 cases, both BG-Ag-RDTs and BG-RT-PCR showed sensitivities and specificities of 100%. Sensitivities of BG-Ag-RDT and BG-RT-PCR toward salivary viral detection were highly concordant, with no discrimination between symptomatic (97.0%), asymptomatic (100%), or SARS-CoV-2 variant (100%) cases. The intermolecular interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and truncated canavalin, an active ingredient from the bean extract (BE), were observed in terms of physicochemical properties. The detachment of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain from hACE2 increased as the BE concentration increased, allowing the release of the virus from hACE2 for early diagnosis. Using BG-based saliva specimens remarkably enhances the Ag-RDT diagnostic performance as an alternative to NPS and enables noninvasive, rapid, and accurate COVID-19 self-testing and mass screening, supporting efficient COVID-19 management. IMPORTANCE An Ag-RDT is less likely to be accepted as an initial test method for early diagnosis owing to its low sensitivity. However, our self-collection method, Ag-RDT using BG-based saliva specimens, showed significantly enhanced detection sensitivity and specificity toward SARS-CoV-2 including the Alpha and Delta variants in all patients tested within 6 days of illness. The method represents an attractive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for the early diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. The evidence suggests that the method could have a potential for mass screening and monitoring of COVID-19 cases.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35171037/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/01614-21 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.01614-21 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.01614-21", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35023417, "aid": "10.1177_00333549211061770 10.1177/00333549211061770", "titl": "Implementation of a COVID-19 Screening Testing Program in a Rural, Tribal Nation: Experience of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, January-February 2021.", "mesh": "Arizona/epidemiology;;; COVID-19/*diagnosis;;; *COVID-19 Serological Testing;;; *Diagnostic Screening Programs;;; Humans;;; *Indigenous Peoples;;; Pilot Projects;;; Program Evaluation;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; *American Indian or Alaska Native", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Chidavaenzi, Natsai Zhou; Agathis, Nickolas; Lees, Yvonne; Stevens, Heidi; Clark, James; Reede, David; Kunkel, Amber; Balajee, S Arunmozhi", "jour": "Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)", "affl": "Department of Health and Human Services, San Carlos Apache Tribe, San Carlos, AZ, USA.;;; Epidemic Intelligence Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.;;; COVID-19 Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.;;; Department of Health and Human Services, San Carlos Apache Tribe, San Carlos, AZ, USA.;;; Department of Health and Human Services, San Carlos Apache Tribe, San Carlos, AZ, USA.;;; San Carlos Apache Health Corporation, San Carlos Apache Tribe, Peridot, AZ, USA.;;; Department of Health and Human Services, San Carlos Apache Tribe, San Carlos, AZ, USA.;;; Epidemic Intelligence Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.;;; COVID-19 Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.;;; COVID-19 Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Mar-Apr", "tiab": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected tribal populations, including the San Carlos Apache Tribe.

Accordingly, tribal partners, with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, implemented a serial testing program using the Abbott BinaxNOW rapid antigen test in 2 tribal casinos and 1 detention center on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation for a 4-week pilot period from January to February 2021. Staff members at each setting, and incarcerated adults at the detention center, were tested every 3 or 4 days with BinaxNOW. During the 4-week period, 3834 tests were performed among 716 participants at the sites. Lessons learned from implementing this program included demonstrating (1) the plausibility of screening testing programs in casino and prison settings, (2) the utility of training non-laboratory personnel in rapid testing protocols that allow task shifting and reduce the workload on public health employees and laboratory staff, (3) the importance of building and strengthening partnerships with representatives from the community and public and private sectors, and (4) the need to implement systems that ensure confidentiality of test results and promote compliance among participants.

METHODS: From a prospective cohort of 3975 adult essential and frontline workers tested weekly from August 2020 to March 2021 for SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay irrespective of symptoms, 497 participants had sera drawn after infection (170), vaccination (327), and after both infection and vaccination (50 from the infection population). Serum was collected after infection and each vaccine dose. Serum-neutralizing antibody titers against USA-WA1/2020-spike pseudotype virus were determined by the 50% inhibitory dilution. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and corresponding fold increases were calculated using t tests and linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Among 170 unvaccinated participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 158 (93%) developed nAbs with a GMT of 1003 (95% confidence interval, 766-1315). Among 139 previously uninfected participants, 138 (99%) developed nAbs after mRNA vaccine dose 2 with a GMT of 3257 (2596-4052). GMT was higher among those receiving mRNA-1273 vaccine (GMT, 4698; 3186-6926) compared with BNT162b2 vaccine (GMT, 2309; 1825-2919).

Following the implementation of stringent public health measures, the daily number of reported cases fell from over 50,000 to below 2000. Although outbreaks steadily receded, the government rolled out a 3-day \"voluntary universal rapid testing\" campaign to invite all citizens to self-perform a rapid antigen test (RAT) daily to identify undetected prevalent infections. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the uptake and results of RAT mass screening to estimate the population's residual epidemic burden and assess the risk of further transmission. METHODS: A cross-sectional study comprising an open web-based population-based survey was conducted a week after the RAT campaign. Participants were asked to report their COVID-19 vaccination and infection history and the RAT performance and test result during the period. They were also invited to report their coliving individuals' test performance and results. Reasons for nonuptake were enquired. Testing and positive rates were age-adjusted. Determinants of undergoing RAT were identified using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: In total, particulars from 21,769 individuals were reported by 8338 participants. The overall age-adjusted testing rate was 74.94% (95% CI 73.71%-76.18%), with over 80% of participants in the age groups between 45-84 years having self-performed RAT during the campaign period. After age-adjustment, 1.03% (95% CI 0.86%-1.21%) of participants tested positive. The positive rates in the age groups between 20-29 years and >84 years exceeded 2%. Taking into account the positive rate and 5819 reported cases during the period, the cases identified in the campaign might account for 7.65% (95% CI 6.47%-9.14%) of all infections. Testers were more likely to be female, older, not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, and have received COVID-19 vaccination. Adjusting for the number of household members, those living with a child aged <12 years and whose household members were also tested were more likely to have self-performed an RAT. Main reasons for not performing an RAT included the absence of symptoms (598/1108, 53.97%), disbelief of the appropriateness of the campaign as an antiepidemic measure (355/1108, 32.04%), and a recent COVID-19 diagnosis (332/1108, 29.96%). CONCLUSIONS: The residual population burden remained substantial in spite of the clear evidence of a receding epidemic wave.

As SARS-CoV-2 vaccination progresses, COVID-19 in elderly people has markedly reduced. We investigated changes in diagnostic usefulness of the JRS scoring system in COVID-19 pneumonia between the Delta variant group (vaccination period) and non-Delta variant group (before the vaccination period). METHODS: This study was conducted at five institutions and assessed a total of 1121 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (298 had the Delta variant). During the vaccination period, the Delta variant has spread and replaced the Alfa variant. We evaluated the vaccination period as the Delta variant group. RESULTS: Among the six parameters of the JRS scoring system, matching rates of two parameters were higher in the Delta variant group than the non-Delta variant group (pre-vaccination period): age <60 years (77.5% vs 42.2%, P < 0.0001) and no or minor comorbid illness (69.1% vs 57.8%, p = 0.0007). The sensitivity of the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly higher in the Delta variant group compared with the non-Delta variant group (80.2% vs 58.3%, p < 0.0001). When the diagnostic sensitivity was analyzed for different ages, the diagnostic sensitivities for the Delta variant and non-Delta variant groups were 92.6% and 95.5% for non-elderly patients and 39.1% and 32.5% for elderly patients, respectively.

Since the accuracy may have altered by changes in SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, indications for testing, sampling and testing procedures, and roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination, we evaluated the performance of three prevailing SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we consecutively enrolled individuals aged >16 years presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing at three Dutch public health service COVID-19 test sites. In the first phase, participants underwent either BD-Veritor System (Becton Dickinson), PanBio (Abbott), or SD-Biosensor (Roche Diagnostics) testing with routine sampling procedures. In a subsequent phase, participants underwent SD-Biosensor testing with a less invasive sampling method (combined oropharyngeal-nasal [OP-N] swab). Diagnostic accuracies were assessed against molecular testing. RESULTS: Six thousand nine hundred fifty-five of 7005 participants (99%) with results from both an Ag-RDT and a molecular reference test were analysed. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and overall sensitivities were 13% (188/1441) and 69% (129/188, 95% CI 62-75) for BD-Veritor, 8% (173/2056) and 69% (119/173, 61-76) for PanBio, and 12% (215/1769) and 74% (160/215, 68-80) for SD-Biosensor with routine sampling and 10% (164/1689) and 75% (123/164, 68-81) for SD-Biosensor with OP-N sampling. In those symptomatic or asymptomatic at sampling, sensitivities were 72-83% and 54-56%, respectively. Above a viral load cut-off (>/=5.2 log(10) SARS-CoV-2 E-gene copies/mL), sensitivities were 86% (125/146, 79-91) for BD-Veritor, 89% (108/121, 82-94) for PanBio, and 88% (160/182, 82-92) for SD-Biosensor with routine sampling and 84% (118/141, 77-89) with OP-N sampling. Specificities were >99% for all tests in most analyses. Sixty-one per cent of false-negative Ag-RDT participants returned for testing within 14 days (median: 3 days, interquartile range 3) of whom 90% tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: Overall sensitivities of three SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs were 69-75%, increasing to >/=86% above a viral load cut-off. The decreased sensitivity among asymptomatic participants and high positivity rate during follow-up in false-negative Ag-RDT participants emphasise the need for education of the public about the importance of re-testing after an initial negative Ag-RDT should symptoms develop.

Consistently over a 14-month period half of COVID-19 infections (414 of 820, total) were detected through the asymptomatic screening program, a third of whom never developed any symptoms during follow-up. Prompt detection and isolation of these cases substantially reduced the risk of potential workplace and outside of workplace transmission.

METHODS: We established a national registry of AIIRD patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including demographic data, AIIRD diagnosis, duration and systemic involvement, comorbidities, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, clinical course, and dates of vaccinations. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Israel experienced 4 outbreaks of COVID-19 until 30.11.2021. The first three outbreaks (1.3.2020 - 30.4.2021) comprised 298 AIIRD patients. 64.9% had a mild disease and 24.2% had a severe course; 161 (53.3%) patients were hospitalized, 27 (8.9%) died. The 4(th) outbreak (delta variant), starting 6 months after the beginning of the vaccination campaign comprised 110 patients. Despite similar demographic and clinical characteristics, a smaller proportion of AIIRD patients had negative outcomes as compared to the first 3 outbreaks, with regards to severity (16 patients,14.5%), hospitalization (29 patients, 26.4%) and death (7 patients, 6.4%). COVID-19 did not seem to influence the AIIRD activity 1-3 months post-recovery. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is more severe and has an increased mortality in active AIIRD patients with systemic involvement, older age and comorbidities.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a matched case-control study among adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who had results from a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Immunization histories, relevant clinical data, and RT-PCR test results were obtained from the Yale New Haven Health System's medical records between June 1, 2021, and August 15, 2021, when the Delta variant caused 92% of infections in Connecticut. Case participants were defined as adolescents who had a positive test result and an associated medical encounter. Control participants were defined as those who had a negative test result and were matched to a case participant by age, county of residence, and date of testing. EXPOSURES: Adolescents were defined as fully immunized if they had received 2 doses of vaccine at least 14 days before focal time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. The vaccine's effectiveness (VE) was estimated using matched odds ratios from conditional logistic regression models. Secondary measures included estimated VE by clinical symptoms, number of vaccine doses received, and elapsed time from immunization. RESULTS: A total of 6901 adolescents were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample comprised 186 case participants and 356 matched control participants. The median age was 14 (IQR, 13-16) years, 262 (48%) identified as female, 81 (15%) as Black, 82 (15%) as Hispanic, and 297 (55%) as White. Overall, 134 (25%) were fully immunized (case participants, 10 [5%]; control participants, 124 [35%]). The median time between immunization and the SARS-CoV-2 test was 62 days (range, 17-129 days). Within 4 months of receiving 2 doses, VE against any infection was estimated to be 91% (95% CI, 80%-96%); against asymptomatic infection, 85% (95% CI, 57%-95%). Effectiveness after a single dose was estimated to be 74% (95% CI, 18%-92%).

SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients without COVID-19 history receiving maintenance dialysis through a national dialysis provider and treated between February 1 and December 18, 2021, with follow-up through January 17, 2022. PREDICTOR: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status. OUTCOMES: All SARS-CoV-2 infections, composite of hospitalization or death following COVID-19. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression was used to determine COVID-19 case rates and vaccine effectiveness. RESULTS: Of 16,213 patients receiving dialysis during the study period, 12,278 (76%) were fully vaccinated, 589 (4%) were partially vaccinated, and 3,346 (21%) were unvaccinated by the end of follow-up. Of 1,225 COVID-19 cases identified, 550 (45%) occurred in unvaccinated patients, and 891 (73%) occurred during the Delta variant-dominant period. Between the pre-Delta period and the Delta-dominant period, vaccine effectiveness rates against a severe COVID-19-related event (hospitalization or death) were 84% and 70%, respectively. In the subset of 3,202 vaccinated patients with at least one anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) assessment, lower anti-spike IgG levels were associated with higher case rates per 10,000 days and higher adjusted hazard ratios for infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization or death.

The colloidal gold method was adopted for 2019-nCoV-specific IgM/IgG antibody detection. The virus nucleic acid test results, clinical records, and serum protein fingerprint results of antibody-positive patients were collected. RESULTS: All samples were examined using the colloidal gold method with two 2019-nCoV-specific IgM/IgG antibody detection kits. Four patients were tested single antibody-positive using both kits. The details were as follows: two cases of IgM ( +) and IgG (-) using plasma and serum separately, two cases of IgM (-) and IgG ( +) using serum and whole blood. The protein fingerprinting results and nucleic acid tests of 2019-nCoV antibodies were negative in the 4 cases. Considering the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and test results, these 4 children were ruled out for 2019-nCoV infection.

We prospectively evaluated the clinical performance of a newly developed antigen test QuickNavi-Flu+COVID19 Ag (Denka Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) which can detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses at the same time with a single testing device. METHODS: We included those who were suspected of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and were referred to a PCR center at Ibaraki prefecture in Japan, between August 2, 2021 to September 13, 2021, when the variant carrying L452R spike mutation of SARS-CoV-2 were prevalent. Additional nasopharyngeal samples and anterior nasal samples were obtained for the antigen test and were compared with a reference real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using nasopharyngeal samples. RESULTS: In total, 1510 nasopharyngeal samples and 862 anterior nasal samples were evaluated. During the study period, influenza viruses were not detected by QuickNavi-Flu+COVID19 Ag and reference real-time RT-PCR. For SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal samples, the sensitivity and specificity of the antigen test were 80.9% and 99.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity using anterior nasal samples were 67.8% and 100%, respectively. In symptomatic cases, the sensitivities increased to 88.3% with nasopharyngeal samples and 73.7% with anterior nasal samples. There were three cases of discrepant results between the antigen test and the real-time RT-PCR. All of them were positive with the antigen test but negative with the real-time RT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Therefore, a community-based serosurvey of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted to understand the effectiveness of Korea's strong containment strategy. METHODS: We collected 5,002 residual sera samples from January 30 to March 3, 2021, from 265 medical facilities in Seoul, 346 in Gyeonggi Province, and 57 in Incheon. Sixty samples from tertiary institutions were excluded. We defined the sub-regions according to the addresses of the medical facilities where the specimens were collected. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 was used for screening, and positivity was confirmed using the SARS-CoV-2 sVNT Kit. Prevalence was estimated using sampling weights and the Wilson score interval for a binomial proportion with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Among the 4,942 specimens, 32 and 25 tested positive for COVID-19 in the screening and confirmatory tests, respectively. The overall crude prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0.51%.

Tests based on Reverse Transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detect both live virus and non-infectious viral RNA. We aimed to determine the duration of infectiousness based on viral culture of nasopharyngeal samples of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective observational study in adult intensive care units with a diagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia. Patients had repeated nasopharyngeal sampling performed after day 10 of ICU admission. Culture positive rate (based on viral culture on Vero cells in a level 4 lab) and Cycle threshold from RT-PCR were measured. RESULTS: Nine patients of the 108 samples (8.3%, 95% CI 3.9-15.2%) grew live virus at a median of 13 days (interquartile range 11-19) after their initial positive test. 74.1% of patients were RT-PCR positive but culture negative, and the remaining (17.6%) were RT-PCR and culture negative. Cycle threshold showed excellent ability to predict the presence of live virus, with a Ct < 25 with an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.97, p < 0.001). The specificity of a Ct > 25 to predict negative viral culture was 100% (95% CI 70-100%). CONCLUSION: 8.3% of our ICU patients with COVID-19 grew live virus at a median of 13 days post-initial positive RT-PCR test.

We hypothesized that immunity to HCoVs would be associated with stronger immunogenicity from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Samples were tested for anti-spike IgG against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 antigens. We first compared samples from vaccinated and unvaccinated participants, to determine which HCoV antibodies were affected by vaccination. We created scatter plots and performed correlation analysis to estimate the extent of the linear relationship between HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibodies. Further, using adjusted log-log multiple regression, we modeled the association between each strain of HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of 1510 participants (mean age of 39 years), 94 (6.2%) had a history of COVID-19. There were significant differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participant in anti-spike antibodies to HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43; however, levels for HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 were similar (suggesting that vaccination did not affect these baseline values). Among vaccinated individuals without prior COVID-19 infection, SARS-COV-2 anti-spike IgG demonstrated a weak positive relationship between both HCoV-229E (r = 0.11) and HCoV-NL63 (r = 0.12). From the adjusted log-log multiple regression model, higher HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 anti-spike IgG antibodies were associated with increased SARS-COV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies. Vaccination appears to result in measurable increases in HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43 IgG levels.

Pooling nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs seems to be a promising strategy, saving time and resources, but it could reduce the sensitivity of the RT-PCR and exacerbate samples management in terms of automation and tracing. In this study, taking advantage of the routine implementation of a screening plan on health workers, we evaluated the feasibility of pool testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis in the presence of low viral load samples. METHOD: Pools were prepared with an automated instrument, mixing 4, 6 or 20 NP specimens, including one, two or none positive samples. Ct values of positive samples were on average about 35 for the four genes analyzed. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of 4-samples and 6-samples pools was 93.1 and 90.0%, respectively. Focussing on pools including one sample with Ct value >/=35 for all analyzed genes, sensitivity decreased to 77.8 and 75.0% for 4- and 6-samples, respectively; pools including two positive samples, resulted positive in any size as well as pools including positive samples with Ct values <35. CONCLUSION: Pool testing strategy should account the balance between cost-effectiveness, dilution effect and prevalence of the infection. Our study demonstrated the good performances in terms of sensitivity and saving resources of pool testing mixing 4 or 6 samples, even including low viral load specimens, in a real screening context possibly affected by prevalence fluctuation.

METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched on August 1, 2021 for studies that reported the serologic response to COVID-19 vaccine in cancer patients. Random effects models were used to achieve pooled serologic response rates and odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: We analyzed 16 observational studies with a total of 1453 patients with cancer. A majority of studies used mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). The proportion of patients achieving a serologic response after a single and two doses of COVID-19 vaccine were 54.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41.0-66.9) and 87.7% (95% CI 82.5-91.5), respectively. Patients with hematologic cancers had a lower response rate after the second dose of vaccine compared to those with solid organ cancers (63.7% vs. 94.9%), which was attributable to the low response rates associated with certain conditions (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma) and therapies (anti-CD20, kinase inhibitors).

The nasopharyngeal swab samples of 21 patients were positive for the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, whereas at least one of the ocular tissue samples in 6 of those patients were positive for the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. However, all ocular swab samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the 26 patients with negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. The mean duration from COVID-19 diagnosis to mortality was 10 days (range 2-27 days) in patients with positive postmortem nasopharyngeal swab samples for SARS-CoV-2, compared with an average of 21 days (1-80 days) in patients who tested negative. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.01).

DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was conducted between December 16, 2020, and March 14, 2021, with HCP who had received at least 1 dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. SETTING: Large healthcare system in New England. INTERVENTIONS: HCP were prompted to complete a symptom survey for 3 days after each vaccination. Reported symptoms generated automated guidance regarding symptom management, SARS-CoV-2 testing requirements, and work restrictions. Overlap symptoms (ie, fever, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, or headache) were categorized as either lower or higher severity.

METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among subjects with either solid or hematological cancers who had received two doses of either mRNA or non-mRNA vaccines within 6 months. The levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG and NAb were analyzed using the Mindray Immunoassay Analyzer CL-900i. Statistical analysis was conducted using mean comparison and regression analysis. RESULT: The mRNA-1273 vaccine had the highest median levels of S-RBD IgG and NAb, followed by BNT162b, ChAdOx1nCoV-19, and BBIBP-CorV/Coronavac. The levels of S-RBD IgG and NAb in subjects vaccinated with mRNA vaccines were significantly higher than those of non-mRNA vaccines when grouped based on their characteristics, including age, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and comorbidity (p<0.05). Furthermore, the S-RBD IgG and NAb levels between the subjects vaccinated with non-mRNA vaccines and the subjects vaccinated with mRNA vaccines were significantly different (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the same types of vaccines. This study demonstrated a very strong correlation between the level of S-RBD IgG and the level of NAb (R = 0.962; p<0.001). The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG was consistently higher compared to the level of NAb.

In our study, we developed an electrochemical biosensing platform based on gold clusters, mercaptoethanol, the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen and bovine serum albumin-modified glassy carbon electrode able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody. Moreover, during the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody in spiked-real samples, the anodic signal of the produced biosensor at 0.85 V decreased as the amount of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody increased. Meanwhile, the recovery and relative standard deviation values for saliva and oropharyngeal swab samples were 97.73% and 3.35% and 102.43% and 4.63%, respectively. In 35 min, the biosensing platform could detect 0.03 fg/mL of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody in synthetic media and spiked-saliva or -oropharyngeal swab samples. The method thus issues a linear response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody from 0.1 fg/mL to 10 pg/mL. The cross-reactivity studies with spike antigens of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and influenza A and the antigen of pneumonia confirmed the excellent selectivity of the proposed method.

METHODS: 531 vaccinees, recruited from healthcare professionals, donated samples before, in between, and after the administration of the two doses of the vaccine. T- and B-cell responses were examined via interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release assay, and antibodies against different epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (S1 and NCP) were detected via ELISA and surrogate neutralization assay. Results were correlated with influencing factors such as age, sex, prior infection, vaccine received (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), and immunosuppression. Furthermore, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were measured to screen for autoimmune responses following vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. RESULTS: No markers of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 were found before the first vaccination. Two weeks after it, specific responses against SARS-CoV-2 were already measurable (median +/- median absolute deviation (MAD): anti-S1 IgG 195.5 +/- 172.7 BAU/mL; IgA 6.7 +/- 4.9 OD; surrogate neutralization 39 +/- 23.7%), and were significantly increased two weeks after the second dose (anti-S1 IgG 3744 +/- 2571.4 BAU/mL; IgA 12 +/- 0 OD; surrogate neutralization 100 +/- 0%, IFN-gamma 1897.2 +/- 886.7 mIU/mL). Responses were stronger for younger participants (this difference decreasing after the second dose). Further influences were previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 (causing significantly stronger responses after the first dose compared to unexposed individuals (p </= 0.0001)) and the vaccine received (significantly stronger reactions for recipients of mRNA-1273 after both doses, p < 0.05-0.0001). Some forms of immunosuppression significantly impeded the immune response to the vaccination (with no observable immune response in three immunosuppressed participants). There was no significant induction of ANAs by the vaccination (no change in qualitative ANA results (p 0.2592) nor ANA titres (p 0.08) from pre-to post-vaccination.

DESIGN: Linked data analysis combining empirical evidence of the accuracy of the Innova LFT, the probability of positive viral culture or transmission to secondary cases, and the distribution of viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals in different settings. SETTING: Testing of individuals with symptoms attending NHS Test-and-Trace centres across the UK, residents without symptoms attending municipal mass testing centres in Liverpool, and students without symptoms screened at the University of Birmingham. PARTICIPANTS: Evidence for the sensitivity of the Innova LFT, based on 70 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 and LFT results. Infectiousness was based on viral culture rates on 246 samples (176 people with SARS-CoV-2) and secondary cases among 2 474 066 contacts; distributions of cycle threshold (Ct) values from 231 497 index individuals attending NHS Test-and-Trace centres; 70 people with SARS-CoV-2 detected in Liverpool and 62 people with SARS-CoV-2 in Birmingham (54 imputed). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The predicted proportions who were missed by LFT and viral culture positive and missed by LFT and sources of secondary cases, in each of the three settings. Predictions were compared with those made by mathematical models. RESULTS: The analysis predicted that of those with a viral culture positive result, Innova would miss 20% attending an NHS Test-and-Trace centre, 29% without symptoms attending municipal mass testing, and 81% attending university screen testing without symptoms, along with 38%, 47%, and 90% of sources of secondary cases. In comparison, two mathematical models underestimated the numbers of missed infectious individuals (8%, 10%, and 32% in the three settings for one model, whereas the assumptions from the second model made it impossible to miss an infectious individual). Owing to the paucity of usable data, the inputs to the analyses are from limited sources. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of infectious people with SARS-CoV-2 missed by LFTs is substantial enough to be of clinical importance. The proportion missed varied between settings because of different viral load distributions and is likely to be highest in those without symptoms.

We used the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the implementation. RESULTS: Reach: We offered testing at ten of twelve eligible shelters. Shelter residents and staff had variable participation across shelters; approximately half of eligible individuals tested at least once; few tested consistently during the study. Effectiveness: 2.2% of participants tested positive. We identified three outbreaks, but none exceeded 5 cases. All BinaxNOW-positive participants were isolated or left the shelters. Adoption: We offered testing to all eligible participants within weeks of the project's initiation. Implementation: Adaptations made to increase reach and improve consistency were promptly implemented. Maintenance: San Francisco Department of Public Health expanded and maintained testing with minimal support after the end of the pilot. CONCLUSION: Rapid and frequent antigen testing for SARS-CoV2 in homeless shelters is a viable alternative to rRT-PCR testing that can lead to immediate isolation of infectious individuals.

Many vaccinated subjects are previously naive to SARS-CoV-2; however, almost all have previously encountered other coronaviruses (CoVs), and the role of this immunity in shaping the vaccine response remains uncharacterized. Here, we use longitudinal samples and highly multiplexed serology to identify mRNA-1273 vaccine-induced antibody responses against a range of CoV Spike epitopes, in both phylogenetically conserved and non-conserved regions. Whereas reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes shows a delayed but progressive increase following vaccination, we observe distinct kinetics for the endemic CoV homologs at conserved sites in Spike S2: these become detectable sooner and decay at later time points. Using homolog-specific antibody depletion and alanine-substitution experiments, we show that these distinct trajectories reflect an evolving cross-reactive response that can distinguish rare, polymorphic residues within these epitopes.

In lower-resource settings, case detection is often limited by a lack of available testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To address global inequities in testing, alternative sample types could be used to increase access to testing by reducing the associated costs. Saliva is a sensitive, minimally invasive and inexpensive diagnostic sample for SARS-CoV-2 detection that is appropriate for asymptomatic surveillance, symptomatic testing and at-home collection. Saliva testing can lessen two major challenges faced by lower- and middle-income countries: constrained resources and overburdened health workers. Saliva sampling enables convenient self-collection and requires fewer resources than swab-based methods. However, saliva testing for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics has not been implemented on a large scale in low- and middle-income countries. While numerous studies based in these settings have demonstrated the usefulness of saliva sampling, there has been insufficient attention on optimizing its implementation in practice. We argue that implementation science research is needed to bridge this gap between evidence and practice. Low- and middle-income countries face many barriers as they continue their efforts to provide mass COVID-19 testing in the face of substantial inequities in global access to vaccines.

METHODS: Here, we evaluated in mice and hamsters the efficacy of a pre-clinical version of the Moderna mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273) and the Johnson & Johnson recombinant adenoviral-vectored vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S) against the B.1.621 (Mu) variant of SARS-CoV-2, which contains spike mutations T95I, Y144S, Y145N, R346K, E484K, N501Y, D614G, P681H, and D950N. FINDINGS: Immunization of 129S2 and K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice with the mRNA-1273 vaccine protected against weight loss, lung infection, and lung pathology after challenge with the B.1.621 or WA1/2020 N501Y/D614G SARS-CoV-2 strain. Similarly, immunization of 129S2 mice and Syrian hamsters with a high dose of Ad26.COV2.S reduced lung infection after B.1.621 virus challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, immunity induced by the mRNA-1273 or Ad26.COV2.S vaccine can protect against the B.1.621 variant of SARS-CoV-2 in multiple animal models.

This method has already been used for clinical specimens; however, its effectiveness in dead bodies has not been reported. This study examined the SmartAmp method using 11 autopsies or postmortem needle biopsies performed from January to May, 2021 (of these, five cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and six cases tested negative). Swab samples were collected from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, or anus and the SmartAmp and qRT-PCR results were compared. For the nasopharynx and oropharynx samples, the same results were obtained for both methods in all cases; however, for the anal swabs, there was one case that was positive according to qRT-PCR but negative according to the SmartAmp method. The SmartAmp method may therefore be less sensitive than qRT-PCR and results may differ in specimens with a low viral load, such as anal swabs.

In this article, we report the design and criteria used to validate immunogenicity assays and the outcome of the validation of serologic and functional assays for the evaluation of functional immune response and antibody titers in human serum. A quantitative cell-based microneutralization (MNT) assay, utilizing a reference standard, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-neutralizing antibodies in human serum and Meso Scale Discovery's multiplex electrochemiluminescence (MSD ECL) assay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid, and receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins were assessed for precision, accuracy, dilutional linearity, selectivity, and specificity using pooled human serum from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-confirmed recovered donors. Both assays met prespecified acceptance criteria for precision, relative accuracy, dilutional linearity, selectivity, and specificity. Both assays demonstrated high specificity for the different SARS-CoV-2 antigens or virus tested, and no significant cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses. An evaluation to compare the neutralizing activity in the MNT assay to the IgG measured using the MSD ECL assay showed a strong correlation between the presence of neutralizing activity and amount of antibodies against the spike and RBD proteins in sera from both convalescent and vaccinated individuals. Finally, the MNT assay was calibrated to the WHO reference standard to enable reporting of results in international units, thus facilitating comparison of immunogenicity data generated by different assays and/or laboratories. The MSD ECL assay has previously been calibrated. In conclusion, these validated assays for the evaluation of functional immune response and antibody titers following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination could provide a relatively simple standardized approach for accurately comparing immune responses to different vaccines and/or vaccination regimens.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35130298/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/PONE-D-21-23828 https://sci-hub.do/10.1371/journal.pone.0262922", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Validation Study", "pl": "United States", "topic": 9, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 34676574, "aid": "JMV27413 10.1002/jmv.27413", "titl": "The evaluation of potential global impact of the N501Y mutation in SARS-COV-2 positive patients.", "mesh": "Adolescent;;; Adult;;; Aged;;; Aged, 80 and over;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;;; Child;;; Child, Preschool;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Infant;;; Male;;; Middle Aged;;; Mutation;;; Retrospective Studies;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; *Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/genetics;;; Young Adult", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Komurcu, Selen Zeliha Mart; Artik, Yakup; Cesur, Nevra Pelin; Tanriverdi, Arzu; Erdogan, Derya Cakir; Celik, Sule; Gulec, Elif Yilmaz", "jour": "Journal of medical virology", "affl": "Department of COVID-19 Diagnostic Center, Ministry of Health University of Health Science, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Kucukcekmece, Turkey.;;; TUSEB, Turkey Institutes of Health COVID-19 Diagnostic Center, Ministry of Health University of Health Science, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Kucukcekmece, Turkey.;;; TUSEB, Turkey Institutes of Health COVID-19 Diagnostic Center, Ministry of Health University of Health Science, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Kucukcekmece, Turkey.;;; Department of COVID-19 Diagnostic Center, Ministry of Health University of Health Science, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Kucukcekmece, Turkey.;;; Department of COVID-19 Diagnostic Center, Ministry of Health University of Health Science, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Kucukcekmece, Turkey.;;; Department of COVID-19 Diagnostic Center, Ministry of Health University of Health Science, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Kucukcekmece, Turkey.;;; Department of COVID-19 Diagnostic Center, Ministry of Health University of Health Science, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Kucukcekmece, Turkey.", "pdat": "2022 Mar", "tiab": "Rapid and reliable detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 mutations are significant to control the contagion and spread rate of the virus.

Workflows to guide the LFA development process exist but moving from target selection to an LFA that is ready for field testing can be labor intensive, resource heavy, and time consuming. To reduce the cost and the duration of the LFA development process, we introduce a novel development platform centered on the flexibility, speed, and throughput of an automated robotic liquid handling system. The system comprises LFA-specific hardware and software that enable large optimization experiments with discrete and continuous variables such as antibody pair selection or reagent concentration. Initial validation of the platform was demonstrated during development of a malaria LFA but was readily expanded to encompass development of SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis LFAs. The validity of the platform, where optimization experiments are run directly on LFAs rather than in solution, was based on a direct comparison between the robotic system and a more traditional ELISA-like method.

In this cohort study, the humoral immune responses, including immunoglobulin levels and the presence of virus-neutralizing antibodies, of 92 vaccinated and/or BA.1/BA.2 convalescent individuals were investigated. Cohorts received two doses of ChAdOx1, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 and subsequent booster vaccination with either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, following BA.1/BA.2 infection. In addition, vaccinated and nonconvalescent or unvaccinated and BA.1 convalescent individuals were studied. Serum and saliva samples were used to determine SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG and IgA titers and neutralizing activity against replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus and the Omicron BA.4/5 variant. Vaccinated/convalescent cohorts demonstrated strongest neutralization against BA.4/5, with 50% neutralization titer (NT(50)) values reaching 174.2; however, neutralization was reduced up to 11-fold, compared to wild-type virus. Both BA.1 convalescent and vaccinated nonconvalescent cohorts displayed the weakest neutralization against BA.4/5, with NT(50) values being reduced to 4.6, accompanied by lower numbers of positive neutralizers. Additionally, salivary neutralization against wild-type virus was strongest in vaccinated and BA.2 convalescent subjects, but this elevated neutralization efficiency was lost when challenged with BA.4/5. Our data support the contention that current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines efficiently induce humoral immunity. However, antiviral effectiveness in serum and saliva is greatly reduced against novel variants of concern. These results suggest an adjustment of current vaccine strategies to an adapted or alternative vaccine delivery, such as mucosal booster vaccinations, which might establish enhanced or even sterilizing immunity against novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. IMPORTANCE Rising incidences of breakthrough infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4/5 have been observed. Although various studies were conducted investigating neutralizing antibodies in sera, mucosal immunity was barely evaluated. Here, we investigated mucosal immunity, since the presence of neutralizing antibodies at mucosal entry sites plays a fundamental role in disease limitation. We found strong induction of serum IgG/IgA, salivary IgA, and neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus in vaccinated/convalescent subjects but detected 10-fold reduced (albeit positive) serum neutralization against BA.4/5. Interestingly, vaccinated and BA.2 convalescent patients demonstrated the greatest serum neutralization against BA.4/5, but this advantageous neutralizing effect was not observed in the saliva. Our data support the contention that current COVID-19 vaccines are very efficient against severe/critical disease progression. Moreover, these results suggest an adjustment of the current vaccine strategy to adapted and alternative vaccine delivery, such as mucosal booster vaccinations, to establish robust sterilizing immunity against novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37098903/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/05163-22 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.05163-22 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.05163-22", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United States", "topic": 2, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36750643, "aid": "7030940 10.1093/cid/ciad063", "titl": "Relative Effectiveness of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination and Booster Dose Combinations Among 18.9 Million Vaccinated Adults During the Early Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Omicron Period-United States, 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022.", "mesh": "Adult;;; Humans;;; Adolescent;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; Ad26COVS1;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Vaccination;;; RNA, Messenger", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Wiegand, Ryan E; Oyalowo, Adewole C; Bull-Otterson, Lara; Egwuogu, Heartley; Thompson, Trevor; Kahihikolo, Ka'imi; Moore, Lori; Jones-Jack, Nkenge; El Kalach, Roua; Srinivasan, Arunkumar; Messer, Ashley; Pilishvili, Tamara; Harris, Aaron M; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Link-Gelles, Ruth; Boehmer, Tegan K", "jour": "Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America", "affl": "COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; Booz Allen Hamilton, McLean, Virginia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; GAP Solutions Inc, Herndon, Virginia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; Booz Allen Hamilton, McLean, Virginia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; Booz Allen Hamilton, McLean, Virginia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; Peraton, Herndon, Virginia, USA.;;; National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.;;; COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.", "pdat": "2023 May 24", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Small sample sizes have limited prior studies' ability to capture severe COVID-19 outcomes, especially among Ad26.COV2.S vaccine recipients.

METHODS: We analyzed two de-identified datasets linked using privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL): insurance claims and retail pharmacy COVID-19 vaccination data. We assessed the presence of COVID-19 diagnosis during January 1-March 31, 2022 in: (1) any claim, (2) outpatient claim, (3) emergency department (ED) claim, (4) inpatient claim, and (5) inpatient claim with intensive care unit (ICU) admission. rVE for each outcome comparing three recipient cohorts (reference: two Ad26.COV2.S doses) was estimated from adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Compared with two Ad26.COV2.S doses, Ad26.COV2.S+mRNA and three mRNA doses were more effective against all COVID-19 outcomes, including 57% (95% CI: 52-62) and 62% (95% CI: 58-65) rVE against an ED visit; 44% (95% CI: 34-52) and 54% (95% CI: 48-59) rVE against hospitalization; and 48% (95% CI: 22-66) and 66% (95% CI: 53-75) rVE against ICU admission, respectively.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs, surface, and air samples were collected from the rooms of 78 inpatients with COVID-19 at 6 acute care hospitals in Toronto from March to May 2020. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA), cultured to determine potential infectivity, and whole viral genomes were sequenced. Association between patient factors and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in surface samples were investigated. RESULTS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA was detected from surfaces (125 of 474 samples; 42 of 78 patients) and air (3 of 146 samples; 3 of 45 patients); 17% (6 of 36) of surface samples from 3 patients yielded viable virus. Viral sequences from nasopharyngeal and surface samples clustered by patient. Multivariable analysis indicated hypoxia at admission, polymerase chain reaction-positive nasopharyngeal swab (cycle threshold of </=30) on or after surface sampling date, higher Charlson comorbidity score, and shorter time from onset of illness to sampling date were significantly associated with detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in surface samples.

Numerous serologic tests and platforms are currently available to support this line of testing. Two broad antibody testing categories are point-of-care lateral flow immunoassays and semi-quantitative immunoassays performed in clinical laboratories, which typically require blood collected from a finger-stick and a standard venipuncture blood draw, respectively. This study evaluated the use of dried blood spot (DBS) collections as a sample source for COVID-19 antibody testing using an automated clinical laboratory test system. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-four participants in the BLAST COVID-19 seroprevalence study (NCT04349202) were recruited at the time of a scheduled blood draw to have an additional sample taken via finger stick as a DBS collection. Using the EUROIMMUN assay to assess SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG status, DBS specimens were tested on 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post- collection and compared to the reference serum sample obtained from a blood draw for the BLAST COVID-19 study. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG status from DBS collections demonstrated high concordance with serum across all time points (7-28 days). However, the semi-quantitative value from DBS collections was lower on average than that from serum, resulting in increased uncertainty around the equivocal-to-positive analytical decision point. CONCLUSIONS: DBS collections can be substituted for venipuncture when assaying for COVID-19 IgG antibody, with samples being stable for at least 28 days at room temperature. Finger-stick sampling can therefore be advantageous for testing large populations for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies without the need for phlebotomists or immediate processing of samples. We have high confidence in serostaus determination from DBS collections, although the reduced semi-quantitative value may cause some low-level positives to fall into the equivocal or even negative range.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36596443/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0022-1759(22)00207-1 https://sci-hub.do/113420 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jim.2022.113420", "pt": "Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Netherlands", "topic": 9, "prop": 0.6210581543103267}, {"uid": 35225290, "aid": "10.3791/63395", "titl": "Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR Saliva Diagnostic Strategy utilizing Open-Source Pipetting Robots.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;;; Humans;;; Nasopharynx;;; Pandemics;;; RNA, Viral/analysis/genetics;;; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;;; *Robotics;;; SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; Saliva/chemistry;;; Sensitivity and Specificity;;; Specimen Handling/methods", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Ham, Rachel E; Smothers, Austin R; King, Kylie L; Napolitano, Justin M; Swann, Theodore J; Pekarek, Lesslie G; Blenner, Mark A; Dean, Delphine", "jour": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "affl": "Center for Innovative Medical Devices and Sensors (REDDI Lab), Clemson University.;;; Center for Innovative Medical Devices and Sensors (REDDI Lab), Clemson University; Department of Bioengineering, Clemson University.;;; Center for Innovative Medical Devices and Sensors (REDDI Lab), Clemson University.;;; Center for Innovative Medical Devices and Sensors (REDDI Lab), Clemson University.;;; Swann Medicine.;;; Student Health Services, Clemson University.;;; Center for Innovative Medical Devices and Sensors (REDDI Lab), Clemson University; Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Clemson University; Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, University of Delaware.;;; Center for Innovative Medical Devices and Sensors (REDDI Lab), Clemson University; Department of Bioengineering, Clemson University; finou@clemson.edu.", "pdat": "2022 Feb 11", "tiab": "The emergence of the recent SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis introduced key challenges for epidemiological research and clinical testing. Characterized by a high rate of transmission and low mortality, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated accurate and efficient diagnostic testing, particularly in closed populations such as residential universities. Initial availability of nucleic acid testing, like nasopharyngeal swabs, was limited due to supply chain pressure which also delayed reporting of test results. Saliva-based reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing has shown to be comparable in sensitivity and specificity to other testing methods, and saliva collection is less physically invasive to participants. Consequently, we developed a multiplex RT-qPCR diagnostic assay for population surveillance of Clemson University and the surrounding community. The assay utilized open-source liquid handling robots and thermocyclers instead of complex clinical automation systems to optimize workflow and system flexibility. Automation of saliva-based RT-qPCR enables rapid and accurate detection of a wide range of viral RNA concentrations for both large- and small-scale testing demands.

Our study reports on SARS-CoV-2 testing, infection and associated outcomes in Ontario physicians before SARS-CoV-2 vaccination became available on Dec. 14, 2020. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive, population-based cohort study of physicians in Ontario, Canada, from Jan. 25 to Dec. 31, 2020. We included physicians and postgraduate medical trainees who were residents of Ontario and registrants with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario during the study period. We examined the proportion of physicians tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the proportion who tested positive, and how testing and infections varied by certain physician characteristics. We reported on clinical outcomes associated with infection, including hospital admission and death. RESULTS: Of 41 208 physicians (mean age 47 yr; 56.1% male), 19 116 (46.4%) were tested at least once for SARS-CoV-2 infection; 358 tested positive (0.9%). No physicians died within 30 days of testing positive; however, 20/358 (5.6%) were admitted to hospital. By specialty, the proportion tested was highest among postgraduate medical trainees (2531/4125 [61.4%]), emergency physicians (281/478 [58.8%]), infectious disease physicians (33/67 [49.3%]) and family physicians (8857/18 553 [47.7%]).

We report interim results of the first study evaluating safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in healthy Japanese participants. METHODS: This phase 1/2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted in Japan (two sites), enrolled healthy adults aged >/= 20 years with no prior exposure to investigational coronavirus vaccines/treatments, and no known history/risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were stratified by age (< 65/>/= 65 years) and randomised to receive two doses of 100 mug mRNA-1273 or placebo administered as intramuscular injections 28 days apart. Primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike protein-binding antibody level (bAb). A secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody (nAb) response. RESULTS: Participants were enrolled between 21 January and 3 February 2021, and 200 were randomised: mRNA-1273, n = 150 (< 65 years, n = 100; >/= 65 years, n = 50); placebo, n = 50 (< 65 years, n = 40; >/= 65 years, n = 10). Solicited adverse events (AEs) through 7 days after each vaccination occurred in 144/150 (96%) and 19/50 (38%) participants in the mRNA-1273 and placebo arms, respectively. In the mRNA-1273 arm, injection-site pain, myalgia and fatigue were the most frequently reported solicited AEs after each vaccination, irrespective of age. Robust immune responses occurred with mRNA-1273 (n = 147) with a bAb geometric mean fold rise (95% confidence interval [CI]) from baseline of 1009 (865, 1177) and a nAb of 21.7 (19.8, 23.8) at day 57. Seroconversion rates (95% CI) for bAb and nAb were both 100% (97.5, 100) at day 57. No such response occurred with placebo (n = 49). CONCLUSION: Two doses of 100 mug mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and induced significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in a Japanese population aged >/= 20 years.

IMPORTANCE The markets have been flooded with hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, and although there are many published reports on their performance, comparative reports are far fewer and tend to be limited to only a few tests. In this report, we comparatively assessed 35 rapid diagnostic tests or microtiter plate enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) using a large set of samples from individuals with a history of mild to moderate COVID-19, commensurate with the target population for serosurveillance, which included serum samples from individuals previously infected, at undetermined time periods, with other seasonal human coronaviruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-1. The significant heterogeneity in their performances, with only a few tests meeting WHO target product profile performance requirements, highlights the importance of independent comparative assessments to inform the use and procurement of these tests for both diagnostics and epidemiological investigations.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37158743/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/05101-22 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.05101-22 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.05101-22", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 0.9861972971741942}, {"uid": 36467724, "aid": "10.3389/fcimb.2022.1031775", "titl": "Survival and detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants on dry swabs post storage.", "mesh": "Humans;;; COVID-19/diagnosis;;; Pandemics;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; Viral Load/methods;;; *COVID-19 Testing/methods", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Gordhan, Bhavna G; Ealand, Christopher S; Kana, Bavesh D", "jour": "Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology", "affl": "Department of Science and Innovation/National Research Foundation Centre of Excellence for Biomedical TB Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa.;;; Department of Science and Innovation/National Research Foundation Centre of Excellence for Biomedical TB Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa.;;; Department of Science and Innovation/National Research Foundation Centre of Excellence for Biomedical TB Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa.", "pdat": "2022", "tiab": "COVID-19 has resulted in nearly 598 million infections and over 6.46 million deaths since the start of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in 2019. The rapid onset of the pandemic, combined with the emergence of viral variants, crippled many health systems particularly from the perspective of coping with massive diagnostic loads. Shortages of diagnostic kits and capacity forced laboratories to store clinical samples resulting in huge backlogs, the effects of this on diagnostic pickup have not been fully understood. Herein, we investigated the impact of storing SARS-CoV-2 inoculated dry swabs on the detection and viability of four viral strains over a period of 7 days. Viral load, as detected by qRT-PCR, displayed no significant degradation during this time for all viral loads tested. In contrast, there was a ca. 2 log reduction in viral viability as measured by the tissue culture infectious dose (TCID) assay, with 1-3 log viable virus detected on dry swabs after 7 days. When swabs were coated with 10(2) viral copies of the Omicron variant, no viable virus was detected after 24 hours following storage at 4 degrees C or room temperature. However there was no loss of PCR signal over 7 days. All four strains showed comparable growth kinetics and survival when cultured in Vero E6 cells. Our data provide information on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on stored swabs in a clinical setting with important implications for diagnostic pickup and laboratory processing protocols.

The authors stress that in order to minimize the risk of future possible pandemics, prevention strategies are needed, and poor countries need to be enabled to vaccinate their populations in order to prevent new variants from developing.

METHODS: Two to eleven test facilities operated consecutively in three low-income neighbourhoods in Rotterdam, offering the options of walk-in or appointments. Background characteristics were collected at intake and one nasopharyngeal swab was taken and processed using both RDT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Visitors were asked to join a survey for evaluation purposes. RESULTS: In total, 19 773 visitors were tested - 9662 (48.9%) without an appointment. Walk-in visitors were older, lived more often in the proximity of the test facilities, and reported coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related symptoms less often than by-appointment visitors. For 67.7% of the visitors, this was the first time they got tested. A total of 1211 (6.1%) tested SARS-CoV-2-positive with RT-PCR, of whom 309 (25.5%) were asymptomatic. Test uptake increased among residents of the pilot neighbourhoods, especially in the older age groups, compared to people living in comparable neighbourhoods without community-based testing facilities. RDT detected asymptomatic individuals with 71.8% sensitivity, which was acceptable in this high prevalence setting.

The neutralising ability of different vaccines alone or with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection against omicron is not well-known. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we tested the ability of vaccine and natural infection induced antibodies to neutralise omicron variant in a live virus neutralisation assay in four groups of individuals: (i) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, (ii) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, (iii) vaccination with inactivated virus vaccine (BBV152), and (iv) BBV152 vaccination plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcome was fold-change in virus neutralisation titre against omicron compared with ancestral virus. FINDINGS: We included 80 subjects. The geometric mean titre (GMT) of the 50% focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT50) was 380.4 (95% CI: 221.1, 654.7) against the ancestral virus with BBV152 vaccination and 379.3 (95% CI: 185.6, 775.2) with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination alone. GMT for vaccination plus infection groups were 806.1 (95% CI: 478.5, 1357.8) and 1526.2 (95% CI: 853.2, 2730.0), respectively. Against omicron variant, only 5 out of 20 in both BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine only groups, 6 out of 20 in BBV152 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection group, and 9 out of 20 in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection group exhibited neutralisation titres above the lower limit of quantification (1:20) suggesting better neutralisation with prior infection. A reduction of 26.6 and 25.7 fold in FRNT50 titres against Omicron compared to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain was observed for individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection vaccinated with BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, respectively. The corresponding reduction was 57.1 and 58.1 fold, respectively, for vaccinated individuals with prior infection. The 50% neutralisation titre against omicron demonstrated moderate correlation with serum anti-RBD IgG levels [Spearman r: 0.58 (0.41, 0.71)].

RESULTS: Our study showed inferior performance of the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, because of the lack of specificity, which is potentially life-threatening due to the association of nosocomial-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondly, with a sensitivity of 45.5%, it is impossible to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in reflex PCR-testing. Comparison of viral load in RT-PCR positive samples with corresponding antigen results showed a significant difference between antigen positive and negative samples. COVID-19 infection will not be detected in patients admitted to the hospital in an early or late phase, typically associated with low viral loads. Sensitivity increases when testing within 5-7 symptomatic days, but the implementation of this cut-off is impractical in ER settings. However, diagnostic performance is better to detect high viral load (> = 5 log10 copies/mL) linked with contagiousness.

PCR, however, gives no information about the localization of the virus in cells and tissues.

The low figure of merit (FoM) of the LSPR and high-concentration AuNP requirement restrict their limit of detection (LOD), which is approximately ng to mug mL(-1) in antibody detection if there is no other signal or analyte amplification. Improvements in sensitivity have been slow in recent for a long time, and pushing the boundary of the current LOD is a great challenge of current LSPR immunoassays in biosensing. RESULTS: In this work, we developed spectral image contrast-based flow digital nanoplasmon-metry (Flow DiNM) to push the LOD boundary. Comparing the scattering image brightness of AuNPs in two neighboring wavelength bands near the LSPR peak, the peak shift signal is strongly amplified and quickly detected. Introducing digital analysis, the Flow DiNM provides an ultrahigh signal-to-noise ratio and has a lower sample volume requirement. Compared to the conventional analog LSPR immunoassay, Flow DiNM for anti-BSA detection in pure samples has an LOD as low as 1 pg mL(-1) within only a 15-min detection time and 500 muL sample volume. Antibody assays against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in artificial saliva that contained various proteins were also conducted to validate the detection of Flow DiNM in complicated samples.

The EudraVigilance database has provided similar data for the European Economic Area. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize the evolution over time of spontaneous reports of suspected ADRs to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and to observe the effect of a publicized reaction (cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis [CVST]) on reporting rates. METHODS: We used publicly available data on reports of suspected ADRs and doses of vaccine administered, published by the MHRA, EudraVigilance, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to calculate reporting rates. RESULTS: Approximately 4814 Yellow Card reports (23 fatal) per million doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) and 2890 (13 fatal) per million doses of tozinameran (Pfizer/BioNTech) have been lodged. Between 15 March and 31 October 2021, cumulative European reports of CVST rose from 0 to 443 (183 with thrombocytopenia, 72 fatal) with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and from 2 to 315 (9 with thrombocytopenia, 28 fatal) with tozinameran. European cases of retinal vein occlusion and thrombosis rose from 0 to 168 with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and from 1 to 220 with tozinameran; four of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 cases were associated with thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: Reports of fatal adverse reactions to coronavirus vaccines are very rare. Reports of CVST have been made in relation to both vaccines. Most were submitted after the reaction had been publicized. Thrombocytopenia occurred in a minority of cases. Reports linked both vaccines to cases of retinal vein thrombosis, just four cases with thrombocytopenia.

LFAIR was compared to RT-PCR from same-day samples. RESULTS: Using each participant's first sample, LFAIR showed 86.2% sensitivity (95% CI 73.6%-98.8) and 94.3% specificity (88.8%-99.7%) compared to RT-PCR.

METHODS: We consolidated data on COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and outcomes for all public school-going adolescents in Malaysia from September 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021, and estimated the VE against SARS-CoV-2 infections during this period. Cases were defined as positive tests, either by reverse transcriptase- PCR (RT-PCR) or rapid antigen (RTK-Ag) testing, while controls were negative tests. Secondarily, we restricted the analysis to all tests performed in December 2021 and compared VE by month of full vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 175,880 eligible tests (53.4% or 93,995 RT-PCR tests) were included. After full vaccination with BNT162b2, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infections was 65.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.4, 66.9) over the study period. When restricted to tests in December 2021, VEs for those fully vaccinated in September 2021, October 2021, and November 2021 were comparable (60.6% [95% CI 23.7, 81.5], 56.9% [95% CI 51.1, 62.0], and 65.7% [95% CI 59.8, 70.7] respectively).

However, by day 21 and at later time points IgG levels elicited by BNT162b2 were lower than mRNA-1273. Accordingly, the IgG decay curve was steeper for BNT162b2 than mRNA-1273. Age was a significant modifier of IgG levels in recipients of BNT162b2, but not mRNA-1273. After six months, IgG levels elicited by BNT162b2, but not mRNA-1273, were lower than IgG levels in patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 six months earlier.

From the beginning of the pandemic in December 2019 to August 2021, a total of approximately 3.4 billion tests were performed globally. The majority of these tests were restricted to high income countries. Reagents for diagnostic testing became a premium, LMICs either cannot afford or find manufacturers unwilling to supply them with expensive analytical reagents and equipment. From March to December 2020 obtaining testing kits for SARS-CoV-2 testing was a challenge. As the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases increases globally, large-scale testing still remains a challenge in LMICs. The aim of this review paper is to compare the total number and frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 testing in LMICs and high-income countries (HICs) using publicly available data from Worldometer COVID-19, as well as discussing possible interventions and cost-effective measures to increase testing capability in LMICs. In summary, HICs conducted more SARS-CoV-2 testing (USA: 192%, Australia: 146%, Switzerland: 124% and Canada: 113%) compared to middle-income countries (MICs) (Vietnam: 43%, South Africa: 29%, Brazil: 27% and Venezuela: 12%) and low-income countries (LICs) (Bangladesh: 6%, Uganda: 4% and Nigeria: 1%).

The approach utilizes 1 microL microbiological inoculation loops to collect saliva, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to inactivate and release viral genomic RNA, and a diagnostic reaction mix containing polysorbate 80 (Tween 80).

However, new virus variants capable of escaping neutralization activity of serum antibodies elicited in vaccinated individuals have emerged. The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant caused epidemics in regions of the world in which most of the population has been vaccinated. In this study, we aimed to understand what determines individual's susceptibility to Omicron in a scenario of extensive vaccination. For that purpose, we collected nasopharynx swab (n = 286) and blood samples (n = 239) from flu-like symptomatic patients, as well as their vaccination history against COVID-19. We computed the data regarding vaccine history, COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 serology, and viral genome sequencing to evaluate their impact on the number of infections. As main results, we showed that vaccination in general did not reduce the number of individuals infected by Omicron, even with an increased immune response found among vaccinated, noninfected individuals. Nonetheless, we found that individuals who received the third vaccine dose showed significantly reduced susceptibility to Omicron infections.

METHODS: All healthcare personnel, including staff physicians, physicians in training, nurses, laboratory technicians, researchers, students, housekeeping, maintenance, security, and administrative staff were invited to voluntarily participate, after written informed consent. Participants answered a computer-assisted self-administered interview and donated blood samples for antibody testing every three weeks from October 2020 to June 2021. RESULTS: A total of 883 participants (out of 3639 registered employees) contributed with at least one blood sample. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range: 28-46) and 70% were women. The most common occupations were nurse (28%), physician (24%), and administrative staff (22%). Two hundred and ninety participants (32.8%) had a positive-test result in any of the visits, yielding an overall adjusted prevalence of 33.5% for the whole study-period. Two hundred and thirty-five positive tests were identified at the baseline visit (prevalent cases), the remaining 55 positive tests were incident cases. Prevalent cases showed associations with both occupational (institution 2 vs. 1: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.54-3.25; laboratory technician vs. physician: aOR = 4.38, 95% CI: 1.75-10.93) and community (municipality of residence Xochimilco vs. Tlalpan: aOR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.09-3.79) risk-factors. The incidence rate was 3.0 cases per 100 person-months. Incident cases were associated with community-acquired risk, due to contact with suspect/confirmed COVID-19 cases (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.21-5.00). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that between October 2020 and June 2021, healthcare workers of the two largest tertiary COVID-19 referral centers in Mexico City had similar level of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. Most variables associated with exposure in this setting pointed toward community rather than occupational risk. Our observations are consistent with successful occupational medicine programs for SARS-CoV-2 infection control in the participating institutions but suggest the need to strengthen mitigation strategies in the community.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35298500/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/PONE-D-21-27465 https://sci-hub.do/10.1371/journal.pone.0264964", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 5, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36524941, "aid": "02118582-202302000-00002 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000863", "titl": "The Omicron variant wave: Where are we now and what are the prospects?", "mesh": "Humans;;; Child;;; *2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Wang, Mong-Lien; Lin, Yang; Hou, Ju-Fen; Yang, Yi-Ping; Chien, Yueh; Sun, Yi-Chen; Liang, Kung-Hao; Yang, De-Ming; Chang, Tai-Jay; Wu, Cheng-Hsien; Kao, Shou-Yen; Hung, Kai-Feng", "jour": "Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA", "affl": "Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Institute of Food Safety and Health Risk Assessment, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Stomatology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Nursing, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; College of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Ophthalmology, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, The Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Stomatology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Dentistry, School of Dentistry, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Stomatology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Dentistry, School of Dentistry, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;;; Department of Dentistry, School of Dentistry, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.", "pdat": "2023 Feb 1", "tiab": "The Omicron variant BA.2 is the dominant form of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in many countries, including those that have already implemented the strictest quarantine mandates that effectively contained the spread of the previous variants.

Here, we used a novel saliva collection device designed to favour the safe and correct acquisition of the sample, as well as the processivity of the downstream molecular analysis. We tested 1003 nasopharyngeal swabs and paired saliva samples self-collected by individuals recruited at a public drive-through testing facility. An overall moderate concordance (68%) between the two tests was found, with evidence that neither system can diagnose the infection in 100% of the cases. While the two methods performed equally well in symptomatic individuals, their discordance was mainly restricted to samples from convalescent subjects.

Fingerstick blood samples were collected and analyzed from 137 volunteers before and after receiving the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibody could not be detected within the first 7 days after receiving the first vaccine dose, however, the assay reliably detected antibodies from day 14 onwards.

The S1 IgG levels detected in fingerstick samples correlated with the levels found in venous blood plasma samples and with the efficacy of venous blood plasma samples in the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The assay displayed a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.59 mug/mL and was found to be linear in the range of 0.51-1000 mug/mL.

We report a case of biopsy-confirmed lymphohistiocytic myocarditis after Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccination. METHODS: We describe a case of a previously healthy 45-year-old woman who had palpitations, exercise intolerance, and syncope 1 week after her first mRNA-1273 vaccine dose. Laboratory tests and cardiac imaging were compatible with myocarditis. Given her unusual clinical presentation, an endomyocardial biopsy was performed to exclude other potential etiologies. RESULTS: The endomyocardial biopsy specimen showed patchy endocardial and intramyocardial lymphohistiocytic infiltrates with scattered eosinophils and focal myocyte injury. CD3 and CD68 immunostains confirmed the lymphocytic and histiocytic nature of the infiltrate, respectively. A focal histiocytic collection suggestive of an ill-defined granuloma was present. The histologic and immunohistochemical findings of a lymphohistiocytic myocarditis were highly suggestive of a postvaccination hypersensitivity reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is a rare adverse event.

Here we report the results of the open-label, non-randomized part B of a phase 2 trial in which we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a booster injection of 50 microg of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine mRNA-1273 in 344 adult participants immunized 6-8 months earlier with a primary series of two doses of 50 microg or 100 microg of mRNA-1273 ( NCT04405076 ). Neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 at 1 month after the booster were 1.7-fold (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5, 1.9) higher than those at 28 days after the second injection of the primary series, which met the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion (primary immunogenicity objective) and might indicate a memory B cell response. The nAb titers against the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) (exploratory objective) at 1 month after the booster were 2.1-fold (95% CI: 1.8, 2.4) higher than those at 28 days after the second injection of the primary series. The seroresponse rate (95% CI (four-fold rise from baseline)) was 100% (98.7, 100.0) at 28 days after the booster compared to 98.3% (96.0, 99.4) after the primary series. The higher antibody titers at 28 days after the booster dose compared to 28 days after the second dose in the phase 3 COVE study were also observed in two assays for anti-spike IgG antibody measured by ELISA and by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) Multiplex. The frequency of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions after the booster dose was similar to that after the second dose in the primary two-dose series of mRNA-1273 (50 microg or 100 microg); no new signals were observed in the unsolicited adverse events; and no serious adverse events were reported in the 1-month follow-up period. These results show that a booster injection of mRNA-1273 more than 6 months after completing the primary two-dose series is safe and elicited nAb titers that were statistically significantly higher than the peak titers detected after the primary vaccination series, suggesting that a booster dose of mRNA-1273 might result in increased vaccine effectiveness against infection and disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35241844/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41591-022-01739-w https://sci-hub.do/1739 https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41591-022-01739-w", "pt": "Clinical Trial, Phase II; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "pl": "United States", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.9620871969050742}, {"uid": 36560869, "aid": "10.1177_00333549221138853 10.1177/00333549221138853", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Testing Experiences in a Nationwide Sample of Transgender and Gender-Diverse Adults, June-December 2021.", "mesh": "Adult;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Male;;; Gender Identity;;; *Transgender Persons;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis/epidemiology;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Wirtz, Andrea L; Adams, Dee; Poteat, Tonia C; Beckham, S Wilson; Miller, Marissa; Brown, Carter; Reisner, Sari L", "jour": "Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)", "affl": "Center for Public Health and Human Rights, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Center for Public Health and Human Rights, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Department of Social Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.;;; Department of Health, Behavior and Society, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Trans Solutions Research and Resource Center, Indianapolis, IN, USA.;;; Black Transgender Advocacy Coalition, Carrollton, TX, USA.;;; Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Hypertension, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.;;; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.;;; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

We quantified COVID-19 testing experiences and SARS-CoV-2 infection history among transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) people to inform testing strategies and public health responses. METHODS: From June 14 through December 16, 2021, TGD adults enrolled in a US nationwide online survey with optional SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. We used multinomial regression analyses to identify correlates of suspected and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (vs no known infection). We identified correlates of inability to access COVID-19 testing when needed using generalized linear models for binomial variables. RESULTS: Participants (N = 2092) reported trans masculine (30.5%), trans feminine (27.3%), and nonbinary (42.2%) gender identities. Ten percent of respondents had a confirmed history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 29.8% had a history of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonbinary gender (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.12-2.53), experiencing homelessness (aPR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.05-2.60), and food insecurity (aPR = 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03-2.04) were associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Food insecurity (aPR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.10-1.72), chronic physical health condition (aPR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.15-1.80), chronic mental health condition (aPR = 3.65; 95% CI, 2.40-5.56), and increased anticipated discrimination scores (aPR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05) were associated with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirty-four percent (n = 694 of 2024) of participants reported an inability to access COVID-19 testing when needed, which was associated with Latinx or Hispanic ethnicity, inconsistent telephone access, homelessness, disability, and transportation limitations.

METHODS: We enrolled healthcare workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care hospital who received homologous two-dose vaccination, followed by a homologous or heterologous booster mRNA vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgG was measured using ELISA. A linear mixed regression model was used to compare the slope from the peak antibody titre to the lowest antibody titres 3 months after vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 113 HCWs (BNT162b2 (n = 48 [42%]), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n = 52 [46%]) or mRNA-1273 (n = 13 [12%])) were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. More gradual antibody waning was observed over 3 months with the two-dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (ChAdOx1) than with the two-dose BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). In addition, homologous mRNA-1273 booster induced a more durable antibody response than homologous BNT162b2 booster (p < 0.001) or heterologous ChAdOx1-BNT162b2 booster (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Two-dose homologous ChAdOx1 vaccination or homologous mRNA-1273 booster appears to induce more-durable antibody responses than 2-dose homologous mRNA vaccination, homologous BNT162b2 booster, or 2-dose ChAdOx1 followed by BNT62b2 booster, although our findings are based on the relatively short term (3-month) follow-up after the vaccinations and the evaluation of the slopes from different antibody peak levels.

METHODS: Vaccination status and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results from adults in the Capital Region of Denmark (n = 1 549 488) were obtained from national registries. PCR testing was free and widely available. The number of positive PCR tests per individual at risk was calculated as weekly rates. Time to positive PCR test was modelled using Kaplan-Meier methods and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 1 119 574 individuals received the first dose of BNT162b2 and 1 088 879 received a second dose of BNT162b2. Individuals were followed up to 8.7 months after first dose (median: 5.5 months; interquartile ratio: 4.1-8.7). Rates of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 2-4 months after the second dose were 0.21, 0.33, and 0.36 per 1000 individuals per week at risk for July, August, and September, respectively.

HR of SARS-CoV-2 infection after the second dose was 0.2 (95% confidence interval, .05-.48; P = .001) for individuals with 8 months' follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who received 2 doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine had a low risk of breakthrough infection after up to 8 months of follow-up.

International UN- and WHO-led efforts, such as COVAX, have provided SARS-CoV-2 vaccines but half of African countries have less than 2% vaccinated in their population, and only 15 have reached 10% by October 2021, further disadvantaging local economic recovery. Key for this implementation and preventing further mutation and spread is the frequency of voluntary [asymptomatic] testing. It is limited by expensive PCR and LAMP tests, uncomfortable probes deep in the throat or nose, and the availability of hardware to administer in remote locations. There is an urgent need for an inexpensive \"end-to-end\" system to deliver sensitive and reliable, non-invasive tests in resource-poor and field-test conditions. We introduce a non-invasive saliva-based LAMP colorimetric test kit and a $51 lab-in-a-backpack system that detects as few as 4 viral RNA copies per muL. It consists of eight chemicals, a thermometer, a thermos bottle, two micropipettes and a 1000-4000 rcf electronically operated centrifuge made from recycled computer hard drives (CentriDrive). The centrifuge includes a 3D-printed rotor and a 12 V rechargeable Li-ion battery, and its 12 V standard also allows wiring directly to automobile batteries, to enable field-use of this and other tests in low infrastructure settings. The test takes 90 minutes to process 6 samples and has reagent costs of $3.5 per sample. The non-invasive nature of saliva testing would allow higher penetration of testing and wider adoption of the test across cultures and settings (including refugee camps and disaster zones).

Data are lacking on the effectiveness of booster doses for younger individuals and health care workers. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of a BNT162b2 booster dose with SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary medical center in Tel Aviv, Israel. The study cohort included 1928 immunocompetent health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2, and had enrolled between August 8 and 19, 2021, with final follow-up reported through September 20, 2021. Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed every 14 days. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain IgG titers were determined at baseline and 1 month after enrollment. Cox regression with time-dependent analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection between booster-immunized status and 2-dose vaccinated (booster-nonimmunized) status. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with a booster dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among 1928 participants, the median age was 44 years (IQR, 36-52 years) and 1381 were women (71.6%). Participants completed the 2-dose vaccination series a median of 210 days (IQR, 205-213 days) before study enrollment. A total of 1650 participants (85.6%) received the booster dose. During a median follow-up of 39 days (IQR, 35-41 days), SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 44 participants (incidence rate, 60.2 per 100\u202f000 person-days); 31 (70.5%) were symptomatic. Five SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in booster-immunized participants and 39 in booster-nonimmunized participants (incidence rate, 12.8 vs 116 per 100\u202f000 person-days, respectively). In a time-dependent Cox regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for booster-immunized vs booster-nonimmunized participants was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.02-0.20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among health care workers at a single center in Israel who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2, administration of a booster dose compared with not receiving one was associated with a significantly lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over a median of 39 days of follow-up.

SETTING: Linked primary care, hospital, and covid-19 surveillance records available within the OpenSAFELY-TPP research platform, covering a period when the SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants were dominant. PARTICIPANTS: 3 237 918 adults who received a booster dose of either vaccine between 29 October 2021 and 25 February 2022 as part of the national booster programme in England and who received a primary course of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1. INTERVENTION: Vaccination with either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 as a booster vaccine dose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recorded SARS-CoV-2 positive test, covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related death, and non-covid-19 related death at 20 weeks after receipt of the booster dose.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 viral waves in Canada by measuring seropositivity among adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Action to Beat Coronavirus study conducted 2 rounds of an online survey about COVID-19 experience and analyzed immunoglobulin G levels based on participant-collected dried blood spots (DBS) to assess the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first and second viral waves in Canada. A sample of 19 994 Canadian adults (aged >/=18 years) was recruited from established members of the Angus Reid Forum, a public polling organization. The study comprised 2 phases (phase 1 from May 1 to September 30, 2020, and phase 2 from December 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021) that generally corresponded to the first (April 1 to July 31, 2020) and second (October 1, 2020, to March 1, 2021) viral waves. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G seropositivity (using a chemiluminescence assay) by major geographic and demographic variables and correlation with COVID-19 symptom reporting. RESULTS: Among 19 994 adults who completed the online questionnaire in phase 1, the mean (SD) age was 50.9 (15.4) years, and 10 522 participants (51.9%) were female; 2948 participants (14.5%) had self-identified racial and ethnic minority group status, and 1578 participants (8.2%) were self-identified Indigenous Canadians. Among participants in phase 1, 8967 had DBS testing. In phase 2, 14\u202f621 adults completed online questionnaires, and 7102 of those had DBS testing. Of 19 994 adults who completed the online survey in phase 1, fewer had an educational level of some college or less (4747 individuals [33.1%]) compared with the general population in Canada (45.0%). Survey respondents were otherwise representative of the general population, including in prevalence of known risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among unvaccinated adults increased from 1.9% in phase 1 to 6.5% in phase 2. The seropositivity pattern was demographically and geographically heterogeneous during phase 1 but more homogeneous by phase 2 (with a cumulative incidence ranging from 6.4% to 7.0% in most regions). The exception was the Atlantic region, in which cumulative incidence reached only 3.3% (odds ratio [OR] vs Ontario, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-1.02). A total of 47 of 188 adults (25.3%) reporting COVID-19 symptoms during phase 2 were seropositive, and the OR of seropositivity for COVID-19 symptoms was 6.15 (95% CI, 2.02-18.69). In phase 2, 94 of 444 seropositive adults (22.2%) reported having no symptoms. Of 134 seropositive adults in phase 1 who were retested in phase 2, 111 individuals (81.8%) remained seropositive. Participants who had a history of diabetes (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.90) had lower odds of having detectable antibodies in phase 2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The Action to Beat Coronavirus study found that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada was modest until March 2021, and this incidence was lower than the levels of population immunity required to substantially reduce transmission of the virus. Ongoing vaccination efforts remain central to reducing viral transmission and mortality.

In the present study, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) VLPs were used as an alternative to live virus to evaluate the interaction of the virus with DCs. The results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 VLPs induced DC maturation by augmenting cell surface molecule expression (CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)) and inflammatory cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-12p70) in DCs via the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathways. In addition, mature DCs induced by SARS-CoV-2 VLPs promoted T cell proliferation, which was dependent on VLPs concentration.

CRISPR/Cas9-based lateral flow assays are emerging as a powerful alternative for COVID-19 diagnostics. Here, we developed Bio-SCAN (biotin-coupled specific CRISPR-based assay for nucleic acid detection) as an accurate pathogen detection platform that requires no sophisticated equipment or technical expertise. Bio-SCAN detects the SARS-CoV-2 genome in less than 1 h from sample collection to result. In the first step, the target nucleic acid sequence is isothermally amplified in 15 min via recombinase polymerase amplification before being precisely detected by biotin-labeled nuclease-dead SpCas9 (dCas9) on commercially available lateral flow strips. The resulting readout is visible to the naked eye. Compared to other CRISPR-Cas-based pathogen detection assays, Bio-SCAN requires no additional reporters, probes, enhancers, reagents, or sophisticated devices to interpret the results. Bio-SCAN is highly sensitive and successfully detected a clinically relevant level (4 copies/muL) of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. Similarly, Bio-SCAN showed 100% negative and 96% positive predictive agreement with RT-qPCR results when using clinical samples (86 nasopharyngeal swab samples). Furthermore, incorporating variant-specific sgRNAs in the detection reaction allowed Bio-SCAN to efficiently distinguish between the alpha, beta, and delta SARS-CoV-2 variants. Also, our results confirmed that the Bio-SCAN reagents have a long shelf life and can be assembled locally in nonlaboratory and limited-resource settings. Furthermore, the Bio-SCAN platform is compatible with the nucleic acid quick extraction protocol. Our results highlight the potential of Bio-SCAN as a promising point-of-care diagnostic platform that can facilitate low-cost mass screening for SARS-CoV-2.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939798/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1021/acssynbio.1c00499", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35856196, "aid": "10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20220104-00003", "titl": "[Progress in research of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adolescents].", "mesh": "Adolescent;;; Adolescent Development;;; Adult;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Child;;; Humans;;; Prognosis;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Li, K G; Niu, Y; Rui, J; Xu, J W; Zhao, Z Y; Meng, L; Chen, T M; Li, Q", "jour": "Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi", "affl": "State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.;;; Public Health Emergency Center, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, China.;;; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.;;; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.;;; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.;;; Public Health Emergency Center, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, China.;;; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.;;; Public Health Emergency Center, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, China.", "pdat": "2022 Jul 10", "tiab": "As 2019-nCoV vaccine is widely used in the adult population, children and adolescents have gradually become an important susceptible population to 2019-nCoV due to their low coverage of the vaccine and high contact degree.

METHODS: Adults (n = 256) seronegative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) were stratified by age, 18-55 (n = 128), 56-69 (n = 86) and >/=70-year-old (n = 42), and randomized 3:1 to AZD1222 or placebo. Safety, immunogenicity, and exploratory efficacy data were collected until study Day 365. RESULTS: Safety was consistent with previous reports. In AZD1222 vaccinees, humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 steadily declined over time. By Day 365, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding (spike) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) mean antibody titers remained above Day 15 levels and pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies were undetectable in many participants. CONCLUSIONS: AZD1222 is immunogenic and well tolerated in Japanese adults. Expected waning in anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses was observed; spike and RBD antibody titers remained elevated.

METHODS: A survey was emailed to DHCWs in the New Jersey area from December 2020 to January 2021. Perceived safety from regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of self, coworkers, and patients and its association with vaccine hesitancy and risk mitigation were ascertained. Risk Mitigation Strategy (RiMS) scores were computed from groupings of office measures: 1) physical distancing (reduced occupancy, traffic flow, donning of masks, minimal room crowding), 2) personal protective equipment (fitted for N95; donning N95 masks; use of face shields; coverings for head, body, and feet), and 3) environmental disinfection (suction, air filtration, ultraviolet, surface wiping). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 testing of dental professionals, coworkers, and patients were perceived to provide safety at 49%, 55%, and 68%, respectively. While dentists were least likely to feel safe with regular self-testing for SARS-CoV-2 (P < 0.001) as compared with hygienists and assistants, they were more willing than hygienists (P = 0.004; odds ratio, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.21 to 2.66]) and assistants (P < 0.001; odds ratio, 3.32 [95% CI, 1.93 to 5.71]) to receive the vaccine. RiMS scores ranged from 0 to 19 for 467 participants (mean [SD], 10.9 [2.9]). RiMS scores did not significantly differ among groups of DHCWs; however, mean RiMS scores were higher among those who received or planned to receive the COVID-19 vaccine than those with who did not (P = 0.004). DHCWs who felt safer with regular testing had greater RiMS scores than those who did not (11.0 vs. 10.3, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding DHCWs' perception of risk and safety is crucial, as it likely influences attitudes toward testing and implementation of office risk mitigation policies. Clinical studies that correlate risk perception and RiMS with SARS-CoV-2 testing are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of RiMS in dental care settings.

Recently published studies have shown that during periods of high viral load, rapid antigen tests (RAT) yield similar results to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, and when used in serial screening (e.g., every three days), it has a high sensitivity. In this perspective, we recommend RT-PCR combined with RAT at points of entry: (i) RAT can be added to the detection phase at ports of entry to detect asymptomatic infections as early as possible; (ii) RAT can be added to post-entry quarantine every three days or less to reduce the rate of missed detection in later quarantine; (iii) Adding regular RAT to regular PCR testing for key airport personnel to prevent cross-infection and conduct closed-off management. In the face of sporadic Delta variant outbreaks, the combination of the two could help rapid triage and management of suspected populations at an early stage and thus contain the outbreak more quickly and effectively.

METHODS: Sensitivity was determined using samples (n = 124) from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals. Prepandemic (n = 100) and non-COVID respiratory infection positive samples (n = 100) were used to evaluate specificity. Samples were analyzed using COVID-19 IgG multiplex serology assay from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) and using commercial platforms from Abbott, EUROIMMUN, and Siemens. RESULTS: At >14 days post-PCR, MSD assay displayed >98.0% sensitivity [S 100% (95% CI 98.0%-100.0%); N 98.0% (95% CI 97.2%-98.9%); RBD 94.1% (95% CI 92.6%-95.6%); NTD 98.0% (95% CI, 97.2%-98.9%)] and 99% specificity (95% CI 99.3%-99.7%) for antibodies to all 4 antigens.

Individual-level data are not available in many countries, particularly low- and middle- income countries. Using a novel Poisson regression model, we analyzed ecologic data in Costa Rica to estimate vaccine effectiveness and assess the usefulness of this approach. METHODS: We used national data from December 1, 2020 to May 13, 2021 to ascertain incidence, hospitalizations and deaths within ecologic units defined by 14 age groups, gender, 105 geographic areas, and day of the epidemic. Within each unit we used the proportions of the population with one and with two vaccinations, primarily tozinameran. Using a non-standard Poisson regression model that included an ecologic-unit-specific rate factor to describe rates without vaccination and a factor that depended on vaccine effectiveness parameters and proportions vaccinated, we estimated vaccine effectiveness. RESULTS: In 3.621 million persons aged 20 or older, there were 125,031 incident cases, 7716 hospitalizations, and 1929 deaths following SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis; 73% of those aged >/= 75 years received two doses. For one dose, estimated effectiveness was 59% (95% confidence interval 53% to 64%) for SARS-CoV-2 incidence, 76% (68% to 85%) for hospitalizations, and 63% (47% to 80%) for deaths. For two doses, the respective estimates of effectiveness were 93% (90% to 96%), 100% (97% to 100%), and 100% (97% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS: These effectiveness estimates agree well with findings from clinical trials and individual-level observational studies and indicate high effectiveness in the general population of Costa Rica.

The results of the rapid antigen test and the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test using AN samples were compared to those of RT-PCR tests using NP samples. RESULTS: Samples were collected from 800 participants, 95 and 110 of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR tests of AN and NP samples, respectively. The overall sensitivity/specificity of the AN rapid antigen test and AN RT-PCR were 72.7%/100% and 86.4%/100%, respectively. In symptomatic cases, the sensitivities of the AN rapid antigen test and AN RT-PCR were 84.7% and 94.9%, respectively. In asymptomatic cases, the sensitivities of the AN rapid antigen test and AN RT-PCR were 58.8% and 76.5%, respectively. The sensitivity of the AN rapid antigen test was over 80% in cases with cycle threshold (Ct) values < 25; it significantly decreased with an increase in the Ct values (p < 0.001).

These mRNA vaccines included the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273). There is limited understanding of the effectiveness of different primary vaccination courses on mRNA booster vaccines against SARs-COV-2 infections and how time-varying confounders affect these evaluations. METHODS: Trial emulation was applied to a prospective community observational cohort in England and Wales to reduce time-varying confounding-by-indication driven by prioritizing vaccination based upon age, vulnerability and exposure. Trial emulation was conducted by meta-analysing eight adult cohort results whose booster vaccinations were staggered between 16 September 2021 and 05 January 2022 and followed until 23 January 2022. Time from booster vaccination until SARS-CoV-2 infection, loss of follow-up or end of study was modelled using Cox proportional hazard models and adjusted for age, sex, minority ethnic status, clinically vulnerability and deprivation. RESULTS: A total of 19 159 participants were analysed, with 11 709 ChAdOx1 primary courses and 7450 BNT162b2 primary courses. Median age, clinical vulnerability status and infection rates fluctuate through time. In mRNA-boosted adults, 7.4% (n = 863) of boosted adults with a ChAdOx1 primary course experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with 7.7% (n = 571) of those who had BNT162b2 as a primary course. The pooled adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 1.01 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of: 0.90 to 1.13. CONCLUSION: After an mRNA booster dose, we found no difference in protection comparing those with a primary course of BNT162b2 with those with a ChAdOx1 primary course. This contrasts with pre-booster findings where previous research shows greater effectiveness of BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1 in preventing infection.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36655537/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/6992299 https://sci-hub.do/dyad002 https://sci-hub.do/10.1093/ije/dyad002", "pt": "Journal Article; Observational Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "England", "topic": 3, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35459775, "aid": "10.1038/s41598-022-10581-6 10581 10.1038/s41598-022-10581-6", "titl": "Evaluation of efficiency and sensitivity of 1D and 2D sample pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR screening purposes.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Humans;;; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; Sensitivity and Specificity;;; Specimen Handling/methods", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Verwilt, Jasper; Hellemans, Jan; Sante, Tom; Mestdagh, Pieter; Vandesompele, Jo", "jour": "Scientific reports", "affl": "OncoRNALab, Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.;;; Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.;;; Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.;;; Biogazelle, Technologiepark 82, 9052, Zwijnaarde, Belgium.;;; Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.;;; Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.;;; OncoRNALab, Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.;;; Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.;;; Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.;;; Biogazelle, Technologiepark 82, 9052, Zwijnaarde, Belgium.;;; OncoRNALab, Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium. jo.vandesompele@ugent.be.;;; Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium. jo.vandesompele@ugent.be.;;; Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000, Ghent, Belgium. jo.vandesompele@ugent.be.;;; Biogazelle, Technologiepark 82, 9052, Zwijnaarde, Belgium. jo.vandesompele@ugent.be.", "pdat": "2022 Apr 22", "tiab": "To increase the throughput, lower the cost, and save scarce test reagents, laboratories can pool patient samples before SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing.

Aim of the study was to evaluate the antibody level against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients treated with two different mRNA-based vaccines, in a multicenter survey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since April 2020, in the 5 participating Centers, periodic screening of all patients with PCR testing has been performed every 2 weeks. The study included two cohorts of patients on maintenance hemodialysis treated with the BNT162b2 or with the mRNA-1273 Covid-19 vaccine. The tests for antibodies against the receptor-binding domain was performed by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S enzyme immunoassay (Roche Elecsys). RESULTS: Of the 398 included patients, 303 received the BNT162b2 and 95 the mRNA-1273 vaccine. In patients without previous infection, the median levels of anti-S antibodies were 297 U/mL and 1,032 U/mL for those treated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, respectively (p < 0.001). In patients with previous infection, the median levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibodies were 7,516 U/mL and 17,495 U/mL for those treated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, respectively (p = 0.005). The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was significantly associated with protective levels of anti-spike IgG, with 3.6% of low- or non-responders having a CCI of 2-4 versus 18.9% in those with a CCI of 8 or more. The adjusted OR of developing a sufficient antibody level between the two vaccines was 3.91 (p = 0.0766) in favor of mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS: Both of the evaluated mRNA-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 showed good efficacy.

While a few studies have evaluated the incidence of anti-PF4 positivity in anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine recipients, to date no studies have assessed whether an antiplatelet immunological response develops and if this associates with platelet and blood clotting activation. We carried out a prospective study in healthy subjects who received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 vaccines to evaluate platelet-specific and non-specific immune response and in vivo platelet activation and blood clotting activation. Individuals receiving ChAdOx1 and, less so, Ad26.COV2.S developed with high frequency auto- or alloantiplatelet antibodies, increased circulating platelet-derived microvesicles and soluble P-selectin associated with mild blood clotting activation.

In the context of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 2-dose primary vaccination regimens were often selected with short intervals between doses to provide rapid protection while still inducing robust immunity. However, emerging post-authorization evidence has suggested that longer intervals between doses 1 and 2 for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may positively impact robustness and durability of immune responses. Here, the dosing interval for mRNA-1273, a messenger RNA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administered on a 2-dose primary schedule with 4 weeks between doses, was evaluated in mice by varying the dose interval between 1 and 8 weeks and examining immune responses through 24 weeks after dose 2. A dosing interval of 6 to 8 weeks generated the highest level of antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin G binding antibody titers. Differences in binding antibody titers between mRNA-1273 1 microg and 10 microg decreased over time for dosing intervals of >/=4 weeks, suggesting a potential dose-sparing effect. Longer intervals (>/=4 weeks) also increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity and numbers of antibody-secreting cells (including long-lived plasma cells) after the second dose. An interval of 6 to 8 weeks elicited the strongest CD8+ T-cell responses, while an interval of 3 weeks elicited the strongest CD4+ T-cell response.

RESULTS: A total of 90 HCWs with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and who had received the third dose of vaccination were included in this study. The mRNA-1273 vaccine booster was administered 6 months after completing primary vaccination with CoronaVac. After the third dose, the anti-S antibodies level significantly increased, from a median of 41.7 U/mL (interquartile range [IQR], 22.4-92.5) to 28 394 U/mL (IQR, 20 837-41 646) (p <0.0001). After the third dose, seropositivity with the anti-S antibodies level >210 U/mL was observed in all HCWs. Age was negatively associated with the anti-S antibodies level after the mRNA-1273 booster.

The purpose of clinical validation is to place the test into the everyday working process in health care institutions. METHODOLOGY: The clinical validation of Alltest Covid19 antigen test (Alltest, China) and Vivadiag Pro SARS- CoV-2 antigen tests (Vivacheck, China) started in four Slovenian health care institutions in December as a point-of-care test. Institutions compared the results of antigen tests to Seegene Allplex 2019-nCoV rt-PCR assay (SeeGene, South Korea) and Cobas 6800 SARS CoV-2 rt-PCR (Roche, USA). RESULTS: Sensitivity (90.6%, 95% CI = 84.94%-94.36%) and specificity (100%, 95% CI = 99.41%-100%) of Vivadiag Pro SARS CoV-2 Ag test were observed.

METHODS: We performed a diagnostic comparison study by testing nasopharyngeal samples for SARS-CoV-2 using the two reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Assay agreement was assessed by overall percent agreement, negative percent agreement, positive percent agreement, and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 48 nasopharyngeal samples were tested using the two assays. One sample was invalid, and three showed inconclusive results with Real-Q; hence, 44 were included for the comparative analysis. Overall, percent agreement between the assays was 93.2% (95% CI 81.3%-98.6%), Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 86.4% (95% CI 65.1%-97.1%) and negative percent agreement (NPA) was 100% (95% CI 84.6%-100%). The kappa coefficient was 0.86 (95% CI 0.72-1.01). Three samples (6.8%) were positive with DaAn gene kit and negative with Real-Q. The fluorescence intensity for Real-Q reporter dyes was low. CONCLUSION: The two kits showed high levels of concordance in their detection of SARS-CoV-2 despite having different gene targets. The Biosewoom kit can be improved through addressing the fluorescence intensity of the target dyes, and feedback was given to the manufacturer.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882825/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/JCLA24161 https://sci-hub.do/10.1002/jcla.24161", "pt": "Comparative Study; Journal Article", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 0.9234236843805991}, {"uid": 34166499, "aid": "6309017 ciab580 10.1093/cid/ciab580", "titl": "Poor Antibody Response After Two Doses of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Vaccine in Transplant Recipients.", "mesh": "Antibodies, Viral;;; Antibody Formation;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; Transplant Recipients", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Mazzola, Alessandra; Todesco, Eve; Drouin, Sarah; Hazan, Fanny; Marot, Stephane; Thabut, Dominique; Varnous, Shaida; Soulie, Cathia; Barrou, Benoit; Marcelin, Anne-Genevieve; Conti, Filomena", "jour": "Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America", "affl": "Sorbonne Universite, Unite Medicale de Transplantation Hepatique, AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (iPLESP), AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Laboratoire de Virologie, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, Service Medico-chirugical de Transplantation renale, AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, Chirurgie Cardiaque et Thoracique, AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (iPLESP), AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Laboratoire de Virologie, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, Service d'Hepato-gastroenterologie, AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, Chirurgie Cardiaque et Thoracique, AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (iPLESP), AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Laboratoire de Virologie, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, Service Medico-chirugical de Transplantation renale, AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (iPLESP), AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Laboratoire de Virologie, Paris, France.;;; Sorbonne Universite, Unite Medicale de Transplantation Hepatique, AP-HP, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.", "pdat": "2022 Mar 23", "tiab": "A low anti-spike antibody response of 28.6% was observed 28 days after BNT162b2 vaccine second dose among 133 solid organ transplant recipients without previous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Those experiencing homelessness have been particularly impacted because of barriers to practicing social distancing, inability to isolate, and poor access to care. Project Roomkey was established in California as a statewide measure to provide non-congregate shelter options for individuals experiencing homelessness to properly quarantine. On goal in this study was to analyze the effectiveness of hotel rooms as a safe disposition alternative to hospital admission for patients experiencing homelessness and who were also positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study that included chart review of patients who were discharged to the hotel from March 2020-December 2021. We recorded demographic information, index visit details, number of emergency department (ED) visits both a month prior to and following the index visit, admission rates, and number of deaths. RESULTS: During this 21-month study period, a total of 2,015 patients who identified as undomiciled were tested for SARS-COV-2 in the ED for various reasons. Of those patients, 83 were discharged from the ED to the hotel. Of the 83 patients, 40 (48.2%) ultimately tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during their index visit. Two patients returned to the ED within seven days with COVID-19-related symptoms, and 10 patients within 30 days. Two patients required subsequent admission with COVID-19 pneumonia. No deaths were recorded within the 30-day follow-up period.

Following the development of RT-qPCR methods to meet this diagnostic need in January 2020, it became clear from interlaboratory studies that the reported Ct values obtained for the different laboratories showed high variability. Despite this the Ct values were explored as a quantitative cut off to aid clinical decisions based on viral load. Consequently, there was a need to introduce standards to support estimation of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in diagnostic specimens. In a collaborative study, INSTAND established two reference materials (RMs) containing heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads of ~107 copies/mL (RM 1) and ~106 copies/mL (RM 2), respectively. Quantification was performed by RT-qPCR using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards and digital PCR. Between November 2020 and February 2021, German laboratories were invited to use the two RMs to anchor their Ct values measured in routine diagnostic specimens, with the Ct values of the two RMs. A total of 305 laboratories in Germany were supplied with RM 1 and RM 2. The laboratories were requested to report their measured Ct values together with details on the PCR method they used to INSTAND. This resultant 1,109 data sets were differentiated by test system and targeted gene region. Our findings demonstrate that an indispensable prerequisite for linking Ct values to SARS-CoV-2 viral loads is that they are treated as being unique to an individual laboratory. For this reason, clinical guidance based on viral loads should not cite Ct values. The RMs described were a suitable tool to determine the specific laboratory Ct for a given viral load. Furthermore, as Ct values can also vary between runs when using the same instrument, such RMs could be used as run controls to ensure reproducibility of the quantitative measurements.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35051208/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/PONE-D-21-27443 https://sci-hub.do/10.1371/journal.pone.0262656", "pt": "Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 37185639, "aid": "bmjopen-2022-066776 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066776", "titl": "Implementing SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing scale-up in Rwanda: retrospective analysis of national programme data and qualitative findings.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Retrospective Studies;;; COVID-19 Serological Testing;;; Rwanda", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Rutayisire, Robert; Boeke, Caroline E; Joseph, Jessica; Bansal, Namita; Bigirimana, Noella; Demke, Owen; Kallarakal, Ashley; Karame, Prosper; Ndayishimiye, Rodrigue; Umumararungu, Esperance; Peter, Trevor; Khan, Shaukat", "jour": "BMJ open", "affl": "National Reference Laboratory, Rwanda Biomedical Center, Kigali, Rwanda.;;; Clinton Health Access Initiative, Boston, Massachusetts, USA caroline.boeke@mail.harvard.edu.;;; Clinton Health Access Initiative, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Clinton Health Access Initiative, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Rwanda Biomedical Center, Kigali, Rwanda.;;; Clinton Health Access Initiative, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Clinton Health Access Initiative, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Research, Innovation and Data Science, Rwanda Biomedical Center, Kigali, Rwanda.;;; Clinton Health Access Initiative, Kigali, Rwanda.;;; National Reference Laboratory, Rwanda Biomedical Center, Kigali, Rwanda.;;; Clinton Health Access Initiative, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Clinton Health Access Initiative, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.", "pdat": "2023 Apr 26", "tiab": "OBJECTIVES: Reverse transcriptase PCR is the most sensitive test for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. However, the scale-up of these tests in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been limited due to infrastructure and cost. Antigen rapid diagnostic tests are an alternative option for diagnosing active infection that may allow for faster, easier, less expensive and more widespread testing. We compared the implementation of antigen and PCR testing programmes in Rwanda. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed routinely collected PCR and antigen testing data for all reported tests conducted nationally. We administered semiquantitative surveys to healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in COVID-19 testing and care and clients receiving antigen testing. SETTING: Rwanda, November 2020-July 2021. PARTICIPANTS: National SARS-CoV-2 testing data; 49 HCWs involved in COVID-19 testing and care; 145 clients receiving antigen testing. INTERVENTIONS: None (retrospective analysis of programme data). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Test volumes, turnaround times, feasibility and acceptability of antigen testing. RESULTS: Data from 906 204 antigen tests and 445 235 PCR tests were included. Antigen testing increased test availability and case identification compared with PCR and had a median results return time of 0 days (IQR: 0-0). In contrast, PCR testing time ranged from 1 to 18 days depending on the sample collection site/district. Both HCWs and clients indicated that antigen testing was feasible and acceptable. Some HCWs identified stockouts and limited healthcare staff as challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Antigen testing facilitated rapid expansion and decentralisation of SARS-CoV-2 testing across lower tier facilities in Rwanda, contributed to increased case identification, reduced test processing times, and was determined to be feasible and acceptable to clients and providers.

STUDY DESIGN: The Epidemiological Study of Coronavirus in Children of the Spanish Society of Pediatrics is a multicenter study conducted in Spanish children to assess the characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019. In a subset of patients, 3 serial RT-PCR tests on nasopharyngeal swab specimens were performed after the first RT-PCR test, and immunoglobulin G serology for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies was performed in the acute and follow-up (<14 and >/=14 days after diagnosis) phase. RESULTS: In total, 324 patients were included in the study. The median time to RT-PCR negativity was 17 days (IQR, 8-29 days), and 35% of patients remained positive more than 4 weeks after the first RT-PCR test. The probability of RT-PCR negativity did not differ across groups defined by sex, disease severity, immunosuppressive drugs, or clinical phenotype. Globally, 24% of children failed to seroconvert after infection. Seroconversion was associated with hospitalization, persistence of RT-PCR positivity, and days of fever. CONCLUSIONS: Time to RT-PCR negativity was long, regardless of the severity of symptoms or other patient features. This finding should be considered when interpreting RT-PCR results in a child with symptoms, especially those with mild symptoms. Seroprevalence and postimmunization studies should consider that 11 in 4 infected children fail to seroconvert.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34571020/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0022-3476(21)00905-7 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.09.029", "pt": "Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 5, "prop": 0.6987604090436165}, {"uid": 35278306, "aid": "6547848 ciac201 10.1093/cid/ciac201", "titl": "Differential T-Cell Immunity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in mRNA-1273- and BNT162b2-Vaccinated Individuals.", "mesh": "2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; Antibodies, Viral;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; T-Lymphocytes", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Gallagher, Kathleen M E; Leick, Mark B; Larson, Rebecca C; Berger, Trisha R; Katsis, Katelin; Yam, Jennifer Y; Maus, Marcela V", "jour": "Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America", "affl": "Immune Monitoring Laboratory, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USAand.;;; Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Immune Monitoring Laboratory, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Immune Monitoring Laboratory, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.;;; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Aug 24", "tiab": "COVID-19 breakthrough cases among vaccinated individuals demonstrate the value of measuring long-term immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

Until now, there has been no specific, reliable, and effective treatment to combat the virus and its variants. The current standard tedious PCR-based tests have limitations in terms of sensitivity, specificity, turnaround time, and false negative results. Thus, an alternative, rapid, accurate, and sensitive diagnostic tool that can detect viral particles, without the need for amplification or viral replication, is central to infectious disease surveillance. Here, we report MICaFVi (Magnetic Immuno-Capture Flow Virometry), a novel precise nano-biosensor diagnostic assay for coronavirus detection which combines the MNP-based immuno-capture of viruses for enrichment followed by flow-virometry analysis, enabling the sensitive detection of viral particles and pseudoviruses. As proof of concept, virus-mimicking spike-protein-coated silica particles (VM-SPs) were captured using anti-spike-antibody-conjugated MNPs (AS-MNPs) followed by detection using flow cytometry. Our results showed that MICaFVi can successfully detect viral MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-mimicking particles as well as MERS-CoV pseudoviral particles (MERSpp) with high specificity and sensitivity, where a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.9 microg/mL (20 pmol/mL) was achieved.

Whether this translates to reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) is unknown. METHODS: We used the US Department of Veterans Affairs COVID-19 Shared Data Resource to identify all veterans who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 26 January and 31 August 2021. Using International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, codes and attendance at a dialysis clinic/center, we identified those who were on chronic hemodialysis. We used a test-negative, case-control design using a doubly robust logistic regression model to determine the VE of the BNT-162b2 (Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in preventing confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 847 199 veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 26 January and 31 August 2021, there were 6076 veterans on chronic hemodialysis. Among those, we identified 1270 cases (580 fully vaccinated) and 2959 controls (2120 fully vaccinated). The overall VE >14 days after the second dose in preventing documented infection was 68.2% (95% CI: 62.6-72.9%). VE was 68.9% (95% CI: 61.9-74.7%) for Pfizer BNT-162b2 and 66.7% (95% CI: 58.9-73.0%) for Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. There was no difference in VE by age (<70 vs >70 years), race, or sex. There were no events recorded in persons with a Charlson's comorbidity index score <2. CONCLUSIONS: VE of 2 doses of current mRNA vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons on chronic hemodialysis is lower than historic VE rates in the general population. Effects of additional doses in improving VE in this special population need further study.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35139175/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/6525466 https://sci-hub.do/ciac118 https://sci-hub.do/10.1093/cid/ciac118", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "pl": "United States", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 35143473, "aid": "PBIOLOGY-D-21-01244 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001531", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2 antibodies protect against reinfection for at least 6 months in a multicentre seroepidemiological workplace cohort.", "mesh": "Adolescent;;; Adult;;; Aged;;; Antibodies, Viral/*blood;;; COVID-19/epidemiology/*immunology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing;;; COVID-19 Serological Testing;;; Humans;;; Logistic Models;;; Middle Aged;;; Polymerase Chain Reaction;;; Prospective Studies;;; Reinfection/*immunology/prevention & control;;; SARS-CoV-2/immunology;;; Seroepidemiologic Studies;;; Time Factors;;; United States/epidemiology;;; Workplace/statistics & numerical data;;; Young Adult", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Finch, Emilie; Lowe, Rachel; Fischinger, Stephanie; de St Aubin, Michael; Siddiqui, Sameed M; Dayal, Diana; Loesche, Michael A; Rhee, Justin; Beger, Samuel; Hu, Yiyuan; Gluck, Matthew J; Mormann, Benjamin; Hasdianda, Mohammad A; Musk, Elon R; Alter, Galit; Menon, Anil S; Nilles, Eric J; Kucharski, Adam J", "jour": "PLoS biology", "affl": "Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.;;; Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.;;; Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Barcelona, Spain.;;; Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.;;; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Institut fur HIV Forschung, Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany.;;; Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Computational and Systems Biology Program, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Space Exploration Technologies Corp, Hawthorne, California, United States of America.;;; Space Exploration Technologies Corp, Hawthorne, California, United States of America.;;; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Space Exploration Technologies Corp, Hawthorne, California, United States of America.;;; Space Exploration Technologies Corp, Hawthorne, California, United States of America.;;; Space Exploration Technologies Corp, Hawthorne, California, United States of America.;;; Space Exploration Technologies Corp, Hawthorne, California, United States of America.;;; Space Exploration Technologies Corp, Hawthorne, California, United States of America.;;; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Space Exploration Technologies Corp, Hawthorne, California, United States of America.;;; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Space Exploration Technologies Corp, Hawthorne, California, United States of America.;;; Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.;;; Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.", "pdat": "2022 Feb", "tiab": "Identifying the potential for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is crucial for understanding possible long-term epidemic dynamics.

We conducted a multivariable logistic regression investigating the association between baseline serological status and subsequent PCR test result in order to calculate an odds ratio for reinfection. We estimated an odds ratio for reinfection ranging from 0.14 (95% CI: 0.019 to 0.63) to 0.28 (95% CI: 0.05 to 1.1), implying that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline is associated with around 72% to 86% reduced odds of a subsequent PCR positive test based on our point estimates. This suggests that primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against reinfection in the majority of individuals, at least over a 6-month time period.

In addition, in the presence of anisotropic Ag nanostructures (nanostars and triangular nanoplates), the assay exhibited greatly enhanced sensitivity (10 aM) and excellent signal reproducibility.

The accuracy of tests for SARS-CoV-2 has been assessed numerous times, usually in reference to a gold standard diagnosis. One major disadvantage of that approach is the possibility of error due to inaccuracy of the gold standard, which is especially problematic for evaluating testing in a real-world surveillance context. We used an alternative approach known as Bayesian latent class modeling (BLCM), which circumvents the need to designate a gold standard by simultaneously estimating the accuracy of multiple tests. We applied this technique to a collection of 1,716 tests of three types applied to 853 individuals on a university campus during a 1-week period in October 2020. We found that reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) testing of saliva samples performed at a campus facility had higher sensitivity (median, 92.3%; 95% credible interval [CrI], 73.2 to 99.6%) than RT-PCR testing of nasal samples performed at a commercial facility (median, 85.9%; 95% CrI, 54.7 to 99.4%). The reverse was true for specificity, although the specificity of saliva testing was still very high (median, 99.3%; 95% CrI, 98.3 to 99.9%). An antigen test was less sensitive and specific than both of the RT-PCR tests, although the sample sizes with this test were small and the statistical uncertainty was high. These results suggest that RT-PCR testing of saliva samples at a campus facility can be an effective basis for surveillance screening to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a university setting. IMPORTANCE Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been vitally important during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are a variety of methods for testing for this virus, and it is important to understand their accuracy in choosing which one might be best suited for a given application. To estimate the accuracy of three different testing methods, we used a data set collected at a university that involved testing the same samples with multiple tests. Unlike most other estimates of test accuracy, we did not assume that one test was perfect but instead allowed for some degree of inaccuracy in all testing methods. We found that molecular tests performed on saliva samples at a university facility were similarly accurate as molecular tests performed on nasal samples at a commercial facility. An antigen test appeared somewhat less accurate than the molecular tests, but there was high uncertainty about that.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35044220/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/01220-21 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.01220-21 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.01220-21", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35302635, "aid": "2790263 zld220031 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.3073", "titl": "Comparative Effectiveness of Single vs Repeated Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Testing Among Asymptomatic Individuals in a Workplace Setting.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;; *COVID-19 Serological Testing;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Workplace", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Connor, Bradley A; Rogova, Marina; Garcia, Jefferson; Patel, Darshan; Couto-Rodriguez, Mara; Nagy-Szakal, Dorottya; Rendel, Michael", "jour": "JAMA network open", "affl": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.;;; The New York Center for Travel and Tropical Medicine, New York.;;; The New York Center for Travel and Tropical Medicine, New York.;;; The New York Center for Travel and Tropical Medicine, New York.;;; The Reed Group, New York, New York.;;; Biotia, Inc, New York, New York.;;; Biotia, Inc, New York, New York.;;; Department Cell Biology, College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, New York, New York.;;; Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York.;;; Goldman Sachs Group Inc, New York, New York.", "pdat": "2022 Mar 1", "tiab": "This comparative effectiveness research study assesses the accuracy of single vs repeated antigen testing for diagnosis of COVID-19 among asymptomatic individuals in a workplace setting.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35302635/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/2790263 https://sci-hub.do/zld220031 https://sci-hub.do/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.3073", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35388074, "aid": "10.1038/s41598-022-09699-4 9699 10.1038/s41598-022-09699-4", "titl": "Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using dried blood spot for at-home collection.", "mesh": "Antibodies, Viral;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Serological Testing;;; Dried Blood Spot Testing/methods;;; Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Miesse, Peyton K; Collier, Bradley B; Grant, Russell P", "jour": "Scientific reports", "affl": "Center for Esoteric Testing, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Burlington, NC, USA.;;; Center for Esoteric Testing, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Burlington, NC, USA. collib7@labcorp.com.;;; Center for Esoteric Testing, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Burlington, NC, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Apr 6", "tiab": "The utilization of vaccines to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a growing need for expansive serological testing.

The Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific quantitative IgG (VITROS S-IgG) assay has been developed to assess neutralizing antibody (NT antibody) against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies. However, it has not been evaluated in Japan, where the total cases and death toll are lower than the rest of the world. METHODS: The clinical performance of VITROS S-IgG was evaluated by comparing with the NT antibody levels measured by the surrogate virus neutralizing antibody test (sVNT). A total of 332 serum samples from 188 individuals were used. Of these, 219 samples were from 75 COVID-19 patients: 96 samples from 20 severe/critical cases (Group S), and 123 samples from 55 mild/moderate cases (Group M). The remaining 113 samples were from 113 healthcare workers who had received 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. RESULTS: VITROS S-IgG showed good correlation with the cPass sVNT assay (Spearman rho = 0.91). Both VITROS S-IgG and cPass sVNT showed significantly higher plateau levels of antibodies in Group S compared to Group M. Regarding the humoral immune responses after BNT162b2 vaccination, individuals who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibodies had statistically lower titers of both S-IgG and sVNT compared to individuals with a history of COVID-19 and individuals who were positive for N-specific antibodies without history of COVID-19. In individuals who were positive for N-specific antibodies, S-IgG and sVNT titers were similar to individuals with a history of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Although the automated quantitative immunoassay VITROS S-IgG showed a reasonable correlation with sVNT antibodies, there is some discrepancy between Vitros S-IgG and cPass sVNT in milder cases. Thus, VITROS S-IgG can be a useful diagnostic tool in assessing the immune responses to vaccination and herd immunity.

METHODS: A total of 347 nasopharyngeal samples were collected from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the date of onset was obtained from the electronic medical records. The SARS-CoV-2 antigen level was measured using Lumipulse Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag (Presto), while NAAT was performed using the Ampdirect 2019-nCoV Detection Kit. RESULTS: Presto had a sensitivity rate of 95.1% (95% confidence interval: 92.8-97.4) in detecting the SARS-CoV-2 antigen in 347 samples. The number of days from symptom onset to sample collection was negatively correlated with the amount of antigen (r = -0.515) and sensitivity of Presto (r = -0.711). The patients' age was lower in the Presto-negative samples (median age, 39 years) compared with that in the Presto-positive samples (median age, 53 years; p < 0.01). A significant positive correlation was observed between age (excluding teenagers) and Presto sensitivity (r = 0.764). Meanwhile, no association was found between the mutant strain, sex, and Presto results. CONCLUSION: Presto is useful for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 owing to its high sensitivity when the number of days from symptom onset to sample collection is within 12 days. Furthermore, age may affect the results of Presto, and this tool has a relatively low sensitivity in younger patients.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37059393/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S1341-321X(23)00096-X https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jiac.2023.04.005", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Netherlands", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 33966664, "aid": "S0899823X21002221 10.1017/ice.2021.222", "titl": "The utility of paired upper and lower respiratory tract sampling for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in patients with artificial airways.", "mesh": "Humans;;; Child;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis;;; Pandemics;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Respiratory System", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Kitt, Eimear M; Davis, Daniela H; Kerman, Caryn; Sammons, Julia S; Handy, Lori K; Gallagher, Elizabeth; O'Callaghan, Kevin; Harris, Rebecca M; Coffin, Susan E; Bell, Louis M; Chiotos, Kathleen", "jour": "Infection control and hospital epidemiology", "affl": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Department of Infection Prevention and Control, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of Critical Care Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of General Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Department of Infection Prevention and Control, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Department of Infection Prevention and Control, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Center for Healthcare Quality and Analytics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Department of Infection Prevention and Control, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Department of Infection Prevention and Control, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Philadelphia Department of Health, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of General Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.;;; Division of Critical Care Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.", "pdat": "2022 Oct", "tiab": "Early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the CDC recommended collection of a lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimen for severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in addition to the routinely recommended upper respiratory tract (URT) testing in mechanically ventilated patients. Significant operational challenges were noted at our institution using this approach. In this report, we describe our experience with routine collection of paired URT and LRT sample testing. Our results revealed a high concordance between the 2 sources, and that all children tested for SARS-CoV-2 were appropriately diagnosed with URT testing alone.

METHODS: A retrospective matched case-control study of 480 consecutive individuals who underwent surgery at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between May 2020 and November 2020. A total of 240 patients who underwent corneal transplantation with tissue obtained from the Florida Lions Eye Bank were age, race, ethnicity, and sex matched with 240 patients who underwent cataract surgery during the same day and by the same surgical team. Only the first corneal transplant or cataract surgery during this period was considered for each individual. All donors and recipients were deemed SARS-CoV-2 negative by a nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test before surgery. Postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infections were defined as previously SARS-CoV-2(-) individuals who developed symptoms or had a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test during the first postoperative month. RESULTS: Mean age, sex, race, and ethnicity were similar between groups. There were no differences between the corneal transplant and cataract groups in the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection before (5.8% vs. 7.5%, P= 0.6) or after surgery (2.9% vs. 2.9%, P = 1). The rates of postoperative complications did not increase during the pandemic, compared with previously reported ranges.

Little is known regarding the relationship between immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: This study assessed the association between immunogenicity and reactogenicity after 2 mRNA-1273 (100 microg) injections in 1671 total adolescent and adult participants (>/=12 years) from the primary immunogenicity sets of the blinded periods of the Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) and TeenCOVE trials. Associations between immunogenicity through day 57 and solicited adverse reactions (ARs) after the first and second injections of mRNA-1273 were evaluated among participants with and without solicited ARs using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: mRNA-1273 reactogenicity in this combined analysis set was similar to that reported for these trials. The vaccine elicited high neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers (GMTs) in evaluable participants. GMTs at day 57 were significantly higher in participants who experienced solicited systemic ARs after the second injection (1227.2 [1164.4-1293.5]) than those who did not (980.1 [886.8-1083.2], P = .001) and were associated with fever, chills, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia. Significant associations with local ARs were not found. CONCLUSIONS: These data show an association of systemic ARs with increased nAb titers following a second mRNA-1273 injection. While these data indicate systemic ARs are associated with increased antibody titers, high nAb titers were observed in participants after both injections, consistent with the immunogenicity and efficacy in these trials.

In this regard, Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) plays an important role at point of care testing but the low sensitivity attributing towards escape of positive cases is reported as a major disadvantage of RAT which led us to evaluate a RAT kit among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals suspected of CoVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed 329 parallel nasopharyngeal swabs for RAT (Zydus Cadila, India) at the point of collection in a hospital-based facility and RealTime RT-PCR in the laboratory. The performance parameters were analyzed by evaluating the specificity, sensitivity, Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and Kappa coefficient. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity were found to be 75.17% and 98.89% respectively. Positive Predictive value was 98.25% and the negative predictive value was 82.79%. The accuracy between the two techniques was found to be 88.14% with a kappa coefficient of 0.756 (SE: 0.036 and CI at 95%: 0.686 to 0.826) with a good strength of agreement (0.61-0.80) between the two testing techniques. Among the false-negative cases, 22 (59.5%) were asymptomatic having the Cycle Threshold (Ct) range 27 to 32.9 including 12 cases with a history of close contact with the known positive cases (i.e. household contact). The remaining 15 cases (40.5%) were symptomatic having low to moderate Ct values. CONCLUSION: It is observed from the results that the false negative result for symptomatic individuals is a matter of concern as it was noted in 4 cases of our study subjects who required hospitalisation later. Also the positives among asymptomatic contacts are important from epidemiological point of view for isolation and curtailing the infection from spreading in a community. These results support the fact that RAT showing sensitivity below 80% can be used for mass screening purposes with provision for additional testing in case of false negative with symptomatic individuals. Also false-negative results should be interpreted cautiously considering the epidemiological link as well as the clinical condition of the patients.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36759762/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1186/s12879-022-07969-0 https://sci-hub.do/7969 https://sci-hub.do/10.1186/s12879-022-07969-0", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35061822, "aid": "PONE-D-21-06806 10.1371/journal.pone.0262733", "titl": "Could pooled samples method affect SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis accuracy using BGI and Sansure-Biotech RT-PCR kits used in Gabon, Central Africa?", "mesh": "COVID-19/*diagnosis/epidemiology;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing/*standards;;; Gabon/epidemiology;;; Health Services;;; Humans;;; RNA, Viral/*genetics;;; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic/standards;;; SARS-CoV-2/classification/*genetics;;; Sensitivity and Specificity;;; Specimen Handling/*methods", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Mintsa-Nguema, Rodrigue; Zoa-Assoumou, Samira; Mewono, Ludovic; M'Bondoukwe, Noe P; Essono, Paulin; Mengue-Me-Ngou-Milama, Krystina; Boukandou-Mounanga, Marlaine; Ndong-Ngomo, Jacques M; Mintsa-Ndong, Armel; Ngoungou, Edgard B; Bouyou-Akotet, Marielle K; Mbongo-Kama, Elvyre", "jour": "PloS one", "affl": "Research Institute in Tropical Ecology, National Center for Scientific and Technological Research, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Department of Bacteriology-Virology, University of Health Science, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Department of Biology, Higher Normal School, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Department of Parasitology-Mycology, University of Health Science, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; National Laboratory of Public Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; National Laboratory of Public Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Institute of Pharmacopeia and Traditional Medicine, National Center for Scientific and Technological Research, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Department of Parasitology-Mycology, University of Health Science, Libreville, Gabon.;;; National Laboratory of Public Health, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Department of Parasitology-Mycology, University of Health Science, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Department of Parasitology-Mycology, University of Health Science, Libreville, Gabon.;;; Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Libreville, Gabon.", "pdat": "2022", "tiab": "This study aims at establishing specimens pooling approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-PCR BGI and Sansure-Biotech kits used in Gabon. To validate this approach, 14 positive samples, stored at -20 degrees C for three to five weeks were analyzed individually (as gold standard) and in pools of five, eight and ten in the same plate. We created 14 pools of 5, 8 and 10 samples using 40 muL from each of the selected positive samples mixed with 4, 7 and 9 confirmed negative counterparts in a total volume of 200 muL, 320 muL and 400 muL for the pools of 5, 8 and 10 respectively. Both individual and pooled samples testing was conducted according to the BGI and Sansure-Biotech RT-PCR protocols used at the Professor Daniel Gahouma Laboratory (PDGL). Furthermore, the pooling method was also tested by comparing results of 470 unselected samples tested in 94 pools and individually. Results of our experiment showed that using a BGI single positive sample with cycle threshold (Ct) value of 28.42, confirmed by individual testing, detection occurred in all the pools. On the contrary samples with Ct >31 were not detected in pools of 10 and for these samples (Ct value as high as 37.17) their detection was possible in pool of 8. Regarding the Sansure-Biotech kit, positive samples were detected in all the pool sizes tested, irrespective of their Ct values. The specificity of the pooling method was 100% for the BGI and Sansure-Biotech RT-PCR assays. The present study found an increase in the Ct values with pool size for the BGI and Sansure-Biotech assays. This trend was statistically significant (Pearson's r = 0.978; p = 0,022) using the BGI method where the mean Ct values were 24.04+/-1.1, 26.74+/-1.3, 27.91+/-1.1 and 28.32+/-1.1 for the individual, pool of 5, 8 and 10 respectively. The testing of the 470 samples showed that one of the 94 pools had a positive test similar to the individual test using the BGI and Sansure-Biotech kits. The saving of time and economizing test reagents by using the pooling method were demonstrated in this study. Ultimately, the pooling method could be used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 without modifying the accuracy of results in Gabon. We recommend a maximum pool size of 8 for the BGI kit. For the Sansure-Biotech kit, a maximum pool size of 10 can be used without affecting its accuracy compared to the individual testing.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35061822/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/PONE-D-21-06806 https://sci-hub.do/10.1371/journal.pone.0262733", "pt": "Journal Article; Validation Study", "pl": "United States", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 36567161, "aid": "S2212-5345(22)00156-3 10.1016/j.resinv.2022.11.005", "titl": "Antibody responses to second doses of COVID-19 vaccination in lung cancer patients undergoing treatment.", "mesh": "Humans;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Antibody Formation;;; 2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; *COVID-19;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; *Lung Neoplasms;;; Vaccination;;; BNT162 Vaccine", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Narita, Daisuke; Ebina-Shibuya, Risa; Miyauchi, Eisaku; Tsukita, Yoko; Saito, Ryota; Murakami, Koji; Kimura, Nozomu; Sugiura, Hisatoshi", "jour": "Respiratory investigation", "affl": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1, Seiryomachi, Aobaku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan.;;; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1, Seiryomachi, Aobaku, Sendai, Miyagi, 980-8574, Japan.

Sixty-eight patients (86%) received the BNT162 mRNA vaccine and 11 (14%) received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. They were categorized according to the current treatment: control individuals without cancer (cohort A), lung cancer patients who were treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (cohort B), immunotherapy (cohort C), combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and immunotherapy (cohort D), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (cohort E), and radiation therapy (cohort F). RESULTS: Among 69 lung cancer patients (cohort B-F), 57 (83%) had adenocarcinoma, and 66 (96%) had advanced-stage cancer. In the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay, the antibody titer was significantly lower in lung cancer patients than in control individuals (p = 0.01).

The gold-standard for assessing immune protection is viral neutralization; however, few studies involve a large-scale analysis of viral neutralization against the Omicron variant by sera from individuals infected with wild-type virus. OBJECTIVES: 1) To define the degree to which infection versus vaccination with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 induced neutralizing antibodies against Delta and Omicron variants.2) To determine whether clinically available data, such as infection/vaccination timing or antibody status, can predict variant neutralization. METHODS: We examined a longitudinal cohort of 653 subjects with sera collected three times at 3-to-6-month intervals from April 2020 to June 2021. Individuals were categorized according to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination status. Spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were detected via ADVIA Centaur((R)) (Siemens) and Elecsys((R)) (Roche) assays, respectively. The Healgen Scientific((R)) lateral flow assay was used to detect IgG and IgM spike antibody responses. Pseudoviral neutralization assays were performed on all samples using human ACE2 receptor-expressing HEK-293T cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral particles for wild-type (WT), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants. RESULTS: Vaccination after infection led to the highest neutralization titers at all timepoints for all variants. Neutralization was also more durable in the setting of prior infection versus vaccination alone. Spike antibody clinical testing effectively predicted neutralization for wild-type and Delta. However, nucleocapsid antibody presence was the best independent predictor of Omicron neutralization. Neutralization of Omicron was lower than neutralization of either wild-type or Delta virus across all groups and timepoints, with significant activity only present in patients that were first infected and later immunized. CONCLUSIONS: Participants having both infection and vaccination with wild-type virus had the highest neutralizing antibody levels against all variants and had persistence of activity. Neutralization of WT and Delta virus correlated with spike antibody levels against wild-type and Delta variants, but Omicron neutralization was better correlated with evidence of prior infection. These data help explain why 'breakthrough' Omicron infections occurred in previously vaccinated individuals and suggest better protection is observed in those with both vaccination and previous infection.

However, differences in study designs and settings make comparing variants difficult. We aimed to estimate the incubation period for each variant of concern compared with the historical strain within a unique and large study to identify individual factors and circumstances associated with its duration. METHODS: In this case series analysis, we included participants (aged >/=18 years) of the ComCor case-control study in France who had a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis between Oct 27, 2020, and Feb 4, 2022. Eligible participants were those who had the historical strain or a variant of concern during a single encounter with a known index case who was symptomatic and for whom the incubation period could be established, those who reported doing a reverse-transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test, and those who were symptomatic by study completion. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, exposure information, circumstances of infection, and COVID-19 vaccination details were obtained via an online questionnaire, and variants were established through variant typing after RT-PCR testing or by matching the time that a positive test was reported with the predominance of a specific variant. We used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with the duration of the incubation period (defined as the number of days from contact with the index case to symptom onset). FINDINGS: 20 413 participants were eligible for inclusion in this study. Mean incubation period varied across variants: 4.96 days (95% CI 4.90-5.02) for alpha (B.1.1.7), 5.18 days (4.93-5.43) for beta (B.1.351) and gamma (P.1), 4.43 days (4.36-4.49) for delta (B.1.617.2), and 3.61 days (3.55-3.68) for omicron (B.1.1.529) compared with 4.61 days (4.56-4.66) for the historical strain. Participants with omicron had a shorter incubation period than participants with the historical strain (-0.9 days, 95% CI -1.0 to -0.7). The incubation period increased with age (participants aged >/=70 years had an incubation period 0.4 days [0.2 to 0.6] longer than participants aged 18-29 years), in female participants (by 0.1 days, 0.0 to 0.2), and in those who wore a mask during contact with the index case (by 0.2 days, 0.1 to 0.4), and was reduced in those for whom the index case was symptomatic (-0.1 days, -0.2 to -0.1). These data were robust to sensitivity analyses correcting for an over-reporting of incubation periods of 7 days. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is notably reduced in omicron cases compared with all other variants of concern, in young people, after transmission from a symptomatic index case, after transmission to a maskless secondary case, and (to a lesser extent) in men. These findings can inform future COVID-19 contact-tracing strategies and modelling.

With recent resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 cases, the role of booster doses of the vaccine needs to be highlighted. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort study design emulating a target trial, we determined the relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) of a homologous booster dose of a SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine compared with the primary vaccine series alone in preventing infection, hospitalization, and intensive care unit admission, and death in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system in the United States. Among infection-free survivors who received 2 doses of a mRNA vaccine before 30 April 2021, we identified those who received a booster between 22 September and 25 December 2021 and matched them 1:1 with individuals who did not receive a booster. RESULTS: Among 2 384 272 previously uninfected persons with 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine by 30 April 2021, we identified 462 950 booster recipients between 22 September and 25 December 2021, who were matched 1:1 with non-booster recipients. The RVE (95% confidence interval) was 19% (17%-22%) for confirmed infection, 52% (46%-57%) for hospitalization, and 83% (65%-92%) for intensive care unit admission or death. Recipients of the mRNA-1273 vaccine had a lower cumulative incidence of infections and hospitalizations than recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine (log-rank P <.001 for both comparisons).

RESULTS: Compared with unvaccinated persons without prior infection, incident SARS-CoV-2 infection risk was lower in all groups: 54.6% (95% confidence interval, 38.0%-66.8%) lower among unvaccinated, previously infected persons; 80.0% (67.6%-87.7%) lower among fully vaccinated persons without prior infection; and 82.4% (70.8%-89.3%) lower among persons fully vaccinated after prior infection. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by >/=80% and, for those with prior infection, increased protection from prior infection alone.

Over the course of the ongoing pandemic a number of new SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates or variants of concern (VoC) have been identified containing mutations in key proteins. METHODS: In this study we describe the generation and preclinical assessment of a ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine (AZD2816) which expresses the spike protein of the Beta VoC (B.1.351). FINDINGS: We demonstrate that AZD2816 is immunogenic after a single dose. When AZD2816 is used as a booster dose in animals primed with a vaccine encoding the original spike protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/ [AZD1222]), an increase in binding and neutralising antibodies against Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) is observed following each additional dose. In addition, a strong and polyfunctional T cell response was measured all booster regimens. INTERPRETATION: Real world data is demonstrating that one or more doses of licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines confer reduced protection against hospitalisation and deaths caused by divergent VoC, including Omicron. Our data support the ongoing clinical development and testing of booster vaccines to increase immunity against highly mutated VoC.

METHODS: We conducted a test-negative case-control design to estimate BNT162b2 and mRNA1273 primary vaccination and booster effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 during an Omicron surge among employees of the University of Pennsylvania Health System. The study period was between 1 July 2021 and 5 April 2022. We defined the Delta period as 1 July to 12 December 2021 and the Omicron period as beginning 12 December 21. RESULTS: Our sample included 14 520 tests (2776 [19%] positive)-7422 (506 [7%] positive) during Delta and 7098 (2270 [32%] positive) during Omicron. Benchmarked against Delta, the vaccine effectiveness of 2 vaccine doses was lower during Omicron, with no significant protection against infection. Booster doses added significant protection, although they also showed reduced effectiveness during Omicron. Compared with findings in employees who had received 2 vaccine doses, 3 doses of BNT162b2 had a relative effectiveness of 50% (95% confidence interval, 42%-56%) during Omicron, relative to 78% (63%-87%) during Delta; 3 doses of mRNA1273 had a relative effectiveness of 56% (45%-65%) during Omicron, relative to 96% (82%-99%) during Delta.

RESULTS: All five protein sequences are antigenic and non-allergenic proteins; moreover, the spike protein group, including spike glycoprotein (E2) (Peplomer protein), spike fragment and spike glycoprotein fragment, showed acceptable stability, which can be used to design new vaccines against human coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: The selected peptides and the other proteins introduced in this study (HE, orf7a, SARS_X4 domain-containing protein and protein 8) can be employed as a suitable candidate for developing a novel prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine against human coronaviruses.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35538841/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/BIOT-EPUB-123144 https://sci-hub.do/10.2174/1872208316666220504234800", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United Arab Emirates", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 35017783, "aid": "S0300-2896(22)00011-4 10.1016/j.arbres.2022.01.002", "titl": "[Pleuropericardial effusion and systemic inflammatory syndrome secondary to the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine for SARS-CoV-2].", "mesh": "2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;;; Exudates and Transudates;;; Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Boira, Ignacio; Torba, Anastasiya; Castello, Carmen; Esteban, Violeta; Vanes, Sandra; Chiner, Eusebi", "jour": "Archivos de bronconeumologia", "affl": "Servicio de Neumologia, Hospital Universitario San Juan de Alicante, Alicante, Espana.;;; Servicio de Neumologia, Hospital Universitario San Juan de Alicante, Alicante, Espana.;;; Servicio de Neumologia, Hospital Universitario San Juan de Alicante, Alicante, Espana.;;; Servicio de Neumologia, Hospital Universitario San Juan de Alicante, Alicante, Espana.;;; Servicio de Neumologia, Hospital Universitario San Juan de Alicante, Alicante, Espana.;;; Servicio de Neumologia, Hospital Universitario San Juan de Alicante, Alicante, Espana.

Some variation for individual RDT was observed either for Delta vs Omicron detection, or when compared with the previous evaluation, which may be explained both by different panel sizes resulting in different data robustness and potential limitation of batch-to-batch consistency. Additional experiments with three RDT using non-pooled routine clinical samples confirmed comparable performance to detect Delta vs Omicron.

For this reason, assays targeting multiple regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome may be useful for a rapid traceability of either known or new variants, anyway, not all the manufacturers are able to sustain the rapid development of variants. OBJECTIVE: We tested forty nasopharyngeal swabs, resulted positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at low cycle threshold (CT < 25), with SARS-CoV-2 Variants ELITe MGB(R) Kit, which was designed to identify Nigerian variant, possible UK variant and South African or Brazilian variant. RESULTS: During the analysis, we noted an atypical melting curve, different from the other variants recognizable by the kit. The subsequent WGS reported this variant as Kappa, so we assess the possibility of \"suspecting\" the presence of a Kappa variant using SARS-CoV-2 Variants ELITe MGB(R) Kit. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid variant screening followed by WGS offers the opportunity to study mutation dynamics and quickly identify possible variants of interest (VOI) and/or variants of concern (VOC), which is crucial in virus spreading control. Furthermore, an accurate analysis of the melting peak could be useful to suspect the presence of new variants.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35026304/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0166-0934(22)00005-2 https://sci-hub.do/114458 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.114458", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Netherlands", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 37153556, "aid": "10.3389/fimmu.2023.1169666", "titl": "Three doses of a recombinant conjugated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: predicting indicators of a high serologic response-a prospective, single-arm study.", "mesh": "Adult;;; Female;;; Humans;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control/etiology;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines/administration & dosage;;; *Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;;; Prospective Studies;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Tetanus Toxoid", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Barkhordar, Maryam; Chahardouli, Bahram; Biglari, Alireza; Ahmadvand, Mohammad; Bahri, Tanaz; Alaeddini, Farshid; Sharifi Aliabadi, Leyla; Noorani, Seied Saeid; Bagheri Amiri, Fahimeh; Biglari, Mohammad; Shemshadi, Mohammad Reza; Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir; Vaezi, Mohammad", "jour": "Frontiers in immunology", "affl": "Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology, and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology, and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Department of Medical Genetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology, and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology, and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Tehran Heart Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology, and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology, and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.;;; Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology, and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology, and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Cancer & Cell Therapy Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.;;; Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology, and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.", "pdat": "2023", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients must be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 as quickly as possible after transplantation. The difficulty in obtaining recommended SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for allo-HSCT recipients motivated us to utilize an accessible and affordable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with a recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD)-tetanus toxoid (TT)-conjugated platform shortly after allo-HSCT in the developing country of Iran. METHODS: This prospective, single-arm study aimed to investigate immunogenicity and its predictors following a three-dose SARS-CoV-2 RBD-TT-conjugated vaccine regimen administered at 4-week (+/- 1-week) intervals in patients within 3-12 months post allo-HSCT. An immune status ratio (ISR) was measured at baseline and 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) after each vaccine dose using a semiquantitative immunoassay. Using the median ISR as a cut-off point for immune response intensity, we performed a logistic regression analysis to determine the predictive impact of several baseline factors on the intensity of the serologic response following the third vaccination dose. RESULTS: Thirty-six allo-HSCT recipients, with a mean age of 42.42 years and a median time of 133 days between hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) and the start of vaccination, were analyzed. Our findings, using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) model, indicated that, compared with the baseline ISR of 1.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 2.17], the ISR increased significantly during the three-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination regimen. The ISR reached 2.32 (95% CI 1.84 to 2.79; p = 0.010) after the second dose and 3.87 (95% CI 3.25 to 4.48; p = 0.001) after the third dose of vaccine, reflecting 69.44% and 91.66% seropositivity, respectively. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the female sex of the donor [odds ratio (OR) 8.67; p = 0.028] and a higher level donor ISR at allo-HSCT (OR 3.56; p = 0.050) were the two positive predictors of strong immune response following the third vaccine dose. No serious adverse events (i.e., grades 3 and 4) were observed following the vaccination regimen. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that early vaccination of allo-HSCT recipients with a three-dose RBD-TT-conjugated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is safe and could improve the early post-allo-HSCT immune response. We further believe that the pre-allo-HSCT SARS-CoV-2 immunization of donors may enhance post-allo-HSCT seroconversion in allo-HSCT recipients who receive the entire course of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine during the first year after allo-HSCT.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37153556/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1169666", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.7816178652459969}, {"uid": 37255085, "aid": "S0104-42302023000600302 10.1590/1806-9282.20230122", "titl": "Answers to comments on \"Comparison of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) vaccine side effects by age groups\".", "mesh": "Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; *Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus;;; COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;;; *Vaccines", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Tosun, Fadime; Bulbul, Mehmet; Tosun, Ismail", "jour": "Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992)", "affl": "Adiyaman University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation - Adiyaman, Turkey.;;; Karabuk University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology - Karabuk, Turkey.;;; Adiyaman Provincial Health Directorate, Family Health Center Number 10 - Adiyaman, Turkey.", "pdat": "2023", "tiab": "\u0431\u0435\u0437 AB", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37255085/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0104-42302023000600302 https://sci-hub.do/10.1590/1806-9282.20230122", "pt": "Letter", "pl": "Brazil", "topic": 4, "prop": 0.514980733299681}, {"uid": 35731504, "aid": "10.1007/s40620-022-01371-4 1371 10.1007/s40620-022-01371-4", "titl": "Humoral and cellular immune responses to the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster in patients on maintenance dialysis.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Renal Dialysis;;; 2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Immunity, Cellular;;; Immunity, Humoral", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Karakizlis, Hristos; Agarwal, Vipul; Aly, Mostafa; Strecker, Kevin; Csala, Benjamin; Esso, Isla; Chen, Jiangping; Nahrgang, Christian; Wolter, Martin; Slanina, Heiko; Schuttler, Christian G; Jessen, Sonke; Ronco, Claudio; Seeger, Werner; Weimer, Rolf; Sester, Martina; Birk, Horst-Walter; Husain-Syed, Faeq", "jour": "Journal of nephrology", "affl": "Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Klinikstrasse 33, 35392, Giessen, Germany.

As a result of this work, a new formula was developed for the \"boundary condition for contagion containment,\" which, based on a horizontal transmission model, gives the lower limit of sensitivity for a diagnostic test to stop the virus spreading. Two parameters are considered in the model: the level of transmission and the effective reproduction number. In example computations, the formula indicated that a one-off polymerase chain reaction-based test with a sensitivity of 85% would not be sufficient to contain highly contagious infections such as the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, which would likely require a sensitivity close to 100% for its containment.

An efficient immune response was observed in the majority of cases. The obtained ranges of signal values were wide, presumably reflecting specific features of the immune system of individuals. At the same time, these ranges were comparable among the three studied vaccines. The anti-RBD IgG levels after vaccination were also similar to those in the patients with moderate/severe course of the COVID-19, and significantly higher than in the individuals with asymptomatic or light symptomatic courses of the disease. No significant correlation was observed between the levels of anti-RBD IgG and sex or age of the vaccinated individuals. The signals measured at different time points for several individuals after full Sputnik V vaccination did not have a significant tendency to lower within many weeks. The rate of neutralization of the interaction of the RBD with the ACE2 receptor after vaccination with Sputnik V was on average slightly higher than in patients with a moderate/severe course of COVID-19. The importance of the second dose administration of the two-dose Sputnik V vaccine was confirmed: while several individuals had not developed detectable levels of the anti-RBD IgG antibodies after the first dose of Sputnik V, after the second dose the antibody signal became positive for all tested individuals and raised on average 5.4 fold. Finally, we showed that people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed high levels of antibodies, efficiently neutralizing interaction of RBD with ACE2 after the first dose of Sputnik V, with almost no change after the second dose.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35493476/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fimmu.2022.797918", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 2, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36291027, "aid": "bios12100890 biosensors-12-00890 10.3390/bios12100890", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2-on-Chip for Long COVID Management.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Point-of-Care Systems", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Cherusseri, Jayesh; Savio, Claire Mary; Khalid, Mohammad; Chaudhary, Vishal; Numan, Arshid; Varma, Sreekanth J; Menon, Amrutha; Kaushik, Ajeet", "jour": "Biosensors", "affl": "Graphene & Advanced 2D Materials Research Group (GAMRG), School of Engineering and Technology, Sunway University, No. 5, Jalan Universiti, Bandar Sunway, Petaling Jaya 47500, Malaysia.;;; Department of Engineering, Amity University Dubai, Dubai International Academic City P.O.

Recently, more than 50 different types of potential COVID-19 vaccines have been developed to elicit a strong immune response against SARS-CoV-2. However, genetic mutations give rise to the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 which is highly associated with the reduced effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. There is still no efficient antiviral agent to specifically target the SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to discovering a novel potential therapeutic approach to the management of COVID-19. Recently, extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapeutic strategies have received great attention on account of their potential benefits in the administration of viral diseases. EVs are extracellular vesicles containing specific biomolecules which play an important role in cell-to-cell communications. It has been revealed that EVs are involved in the pathogenesis of different inflammatory diseases such as cancer and viral infections. EVs are released from virus-infected cells which could mediate the interaction of infected and uninfected host cells. Hence, these extracellular nanoparticles have been considered a novel approach for drug delivery to mediate the treatment of a wide range of diseases including, COVID-19. EVs are considered a cell-free therapeutic strategy that could ameliorate the cytokine storm and its complications in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, EV-based cargo delivery such as immunomodulatory agents in combination with antiviral drugs may have therapeutic benefits in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we will highlight the potential of EVs as a therapeutic candidate in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

Little is known on dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 serology in African settings. Here, we aimed to characterize the longitudinal antibody response profile to SARS-CoV-2 in Ethiopia. METHODS: In this prospective study, a total of 102 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled. We obtained 802 plasma samples collected serially. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined using four lateral flow immune-assays (LFIAs), and an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. We determined longitudinal antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 as well as seroconversion dynamics. RESULTS: Serological positivity rate ranged between 12%-91%, depending on timing after symptom onset. There was no difference in positivity rate between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. The specificity ranged between 90%-97%. Agreement between different assays ranged between 84%-92%. The estimated positive predictive value (PPV) for IgM or IgG in a scenario with seroprevalence at 5% varies from 33% to 58%. Nonetheless, when the population seroprevalence increases to 25% and 50%, there is a corresponding increases in the estimated PPVs. The estimated negative-predictive value (NPV) in a low seroprevalence scenario (5%) is high (>99%). However, the estimated NPV in a high seroprevalence scenario (50%) for IgM or IgG is reduced significantly to 80% to 85%. Overall, 28/102 (27.5%) seroconverted by one or more assays tested, within a median time of 11 (IQR: 9-15) days post symptom onset. The median seroconversion time among symptomatic cases tended to be shorter when compared to asymptomatic patients [9 (IQR: 6-11) vs. 15 (IQR: 13-21) days; p = 0.002]. Overall, seroconversion reached 100% 5.5 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Notably, of the remaining 74 COVID-19 patients included in the cohort, 64 (62.8%) were positive for antibody at the time of enrollment, and 10 (9.8%) patients failed to mount a detectable antibody response by any of the assays tested during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal assessment of antibody response in African COVID-19 patients revealed heterogeneous responses.

The incidence rate ratio and excess number of hospital admissions or deaths from myocarditis per million people were estimated for the 1 to 28 days after sequential doses of adenovirus (ChAdOx1) or mRNA-based (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273) vaccines, or after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: In 42 842 345 people receiving at least 1 dose of vaccine, 21 242 629 received 3 doses, and 5 934 153 had SARS-CoV-2 infection before or after vaccination. Myocarditis occurred in 2861 (0.007%) people, with 617 events 1 to 28 days after vaccination. Risk of myocarditis was increased in the 1 to 28 days after a first dose of ChAdOx1 (incidence rate ratio, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.09-1.62]) and a first, second, and booster dose of BNT162b2 (1.52 [95% CI, 1.24-1.85]; 1.57 [95% CI, 1.28-1.92], and 1.72 [95% CI, 1.33-2.22], respectively) but was lower than the risks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test before or after vaccination (11.14 [95% CI, 8.64-14.36] and 5.97 [95% CI, 4.54-7.87], respectively). The risk of myocarditis was higher 1 to 28 days after a second dose of mRNA-1273 (11.76 [95% CI, 7.25-19.08]) and persisted after a booster dose (2.64 [95% CI, 1.25-5.58]). Associations were stronger in men younger than 40 years for all vaccines. In men younger than 40 years old, the number of excess myocarditis events per million people was higher after a second dose of mRNA-1273 than after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (97 [95% CI, 91-99] versus 16 [95% CI, 12-18]).

Herein, we assessed different heterologous prime-boost strategies with chimpanzee adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines plus Wuhan-Hu-1 (WH-1) strain (AdW) and Beta variant (AdB) and mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines plus WH-1 strain (ARW) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant (ARO) in 6-week-old female BALB/c mice. AdW and AdB were administered intramuscularly or intranasally, while ARW and ARO were administered intramuscularly. Intranasal or intramuscular vaccination with AdB followed by ARO booster exhibited the highest levels of cross-reactive IgG, pseudovirus-neutralising antibody (PNAb) responses, and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)-binding inhibition rates against different 2019-nCoV variants among all vaccination groups. Moreover, intranasal AdB vaccination followed by ARO induced higher levels of IgA and neutralising antibody responses against live 2019-nCoV than intramuscular AdB vaccination followed by ARO. A single dose of AdB administered intranasally or intramuscularly induced broader cross-NAb responses than AdW. Th1-biased cellular immune response was induced in all vaccination groups. Intramuscular vaccination-only groups exhibited higher levels of Th1 cytokines than intranasal vaccination-only and intranasal vaccination-containing groups. However, no obvious differences were found in the levels of Th2 cytokines between the control and all vaccination groups.

Following this, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) then became the predominant variant. The UK COVID-19 vaccination programme started on 8th December 2020. Prior to the Delta variant, most vaccine effectiveness studies focused on the alpha variant. We therefore aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccines in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic infection with respect to the Delta variant in a UK setting. METHODS: We used anonymised public health record data linked to infection data (PCR) using the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action resource. We then constructed an SIR epidemic model to explain SARS-CoV-2 infection data across the Cheshire and Merseyside region of the UK. Vaccines were assumed to be effective after 21 days for 1 dose and 14 days for 2 doses. RESULTS: We determined that the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in reducing susceptibility to infection is 39% (95% credible interval [34, 43]) and 64% (95% credible interval [61, 67]) for a single dose and a double dose respectively. For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the effectiveness is 20% (95% credible interval [10, 28]) and 84% (95% credible interval [82, 86]) for a single-dose and a double dose respectively. CONCLUSION: Vaccine effectiveness for reducing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection shows noticeable improvement after receiving two doses of either vaccine. Findings also suggest that a full course of the Pfizer-BioNTech provides the optimal protection against infection with the Delta variant.

While primary series vaccination rates are generally high in Southeast Asian (SEA) countries, various factors have limited the rollout and impact of booster doses. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed 79 studies in the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC) VIEW-hub platform on vaccine effectiveness (VE) after primary immunizations with two-dose schedules. VE data were reported for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, and stratified across variants of concern, age, study design and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and combinations of both), vector vaccines (AstraZeneca, AZD1222 [ChAdOx1 nCoV-19] 'Vaxzevria'), and inactivated virus vaccines (CoronaVac). EXPERT OPINION: The most-studied COVID-19 vaccines provide consistently high (>90%) protection against serious clinical outcomes like hospitalizations and deaths, regardless of variant. Additionally, this protection appears equivalent for mRNA vaccines and vector vaccines like AZD1222, as supported by our analysis of Asian and relevant international data, and by insights from SEA experts.

METHODS: In this observational study, 66 individuals were recruited to compare immunogenicity and reactogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Vaccine-induced antibodies were analyzed using ELISA and neutralization assays, specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells were characterized based on intracellular cytokine staining using flow-cytometry after antigen-specific stimulation with parental spike or VOCs. RESULTS: Two doses of NVX-CoV2373 strongly induced anti-spike IgG, although IgG-levels were lower than after vaccination with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (p = 0.006). Regardless of the vaccine and despite different IgG-levels, neutralizing activity towards VOCs was highest for Delta, followed by BA.2 and BA.1. The protein-based vaccine failed to induce any spike-specific CD8 T-cells which were detectable in 3/22 (14%) individuals only. In contrast, spike-specific CD4 T-cells were induced in 18/22 (82%) individuals, although their levels were lower (p<0.001), had lower CTLA-4 expression (p<0.0001) and comprised less multifunctional cells co-expressing IFNgamma, TNFalpha and IL-2 (p = 0.0007). Unlike neutralizing antibodies, NVX-CoV2373-induced CD4 T-cells equally recognized all tested VOCs from Alpha to Omicron. In individuals with a history of infection, one dose of NVX-CoV2373 had similar immunogenicity as two doses in non-infected individuals. The vaccine was overall well tolerated. CONCLUSION: NVX-CoV2373 strongly induced spike-specific antibodies and CD4 T-cells, albeit at lower levels as mRNA-regimens.

METHODS: We studied 2660 US Military Health System beneficiaries with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection-alone (n = 705), vaccination-alone (n = 932), vaccine-after-infection (n = 869), and vaccine-breakthrough-infection (n = 154). Peak anti-spike-immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses through 183 days were compared, with adjustment for vaccine product, demography, and comorbidities. We excluded those with evidence of clinical or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 reinfection from all groups. RESULTS: Multivariable regression results indicated that vaccine-after-infection anti-spike-IgG responses were higher than infection-alone (P < .01), regardless of prior infection severity. An increased time between infection and vaccination was associated with greater post-vaccination IgG response (P < .01). Vaccination-alone elicited a greater IgG response but more rapid waning of IgG (P < .01) compared with infection-alone (P < .01). BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine-receipt was associated with greater IgG responses compared with JNJ-78436735 vaccine-receipt (P < .01), regardless of infection history. Those with vaccine-after-infection or vaccine-breakthrough-infection had a more durable anti-spike-IgG response compared to infection-alone (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine-receipt elicited higher anti-spike-IgG responses than infection-alone, although IgG levels waned faster in those vaccinated (compared to infection-alone). Vaccine-after-infection elicits a greater humoral response compared with vaccine or infection alone; and the timing, but not disease severity, of prior infection predicted these post-vaccination IgG responses. While differences between groups were small in magnitude, these results offer insights into vaccine immunogenicity variations that may help inform vaccination timing strategies.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35608504/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/6591282 https://sci-hub.do/ciac392 https://sci-hub.do/10.1093/cid/ciac392", "pt": "Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "pl": "United States", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.8811986727909483}, {"uid": 36154515, "aid": "10.1177_07487304221124661 10.1177/07487304221124661", "titl": "Time of Day of Vaccination Does Not Associate With SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Titer Following First Dose of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine.", "mesh": "Adult;;; Humans;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines;;; RNA, Messenger;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Circadian Rhythm;;; Vaccination;;; 2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Yamanaka, Yujiro; Yokota, Isao; Yasumoto, Atsushi; Morishita, Eriko; Horiuchi, Hisanori", "jour": "Journal of biological rhythms", "affl": "Laboratory of Life and Health Sciences, Graduate School of Education and Faculty of Education, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.;;; Research and Education Center for Brain Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.;;; Department of Biostatistics, Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.;;; Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.;;; Department of Hematology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.;;; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.", "pdat": "2022 Dec", "tiab": "The immune system exhibits circadian rhythms, and its response to viral infection is influenced by the circadian clock system. Previous studies have reported associations between the time of day of vaccination against COVID-19 and production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer. We examined the effect of vaccination time of day on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer after the first dose of vaccination with the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine in an adult population. A total of 332 Japanese adults participated in the present study. All participants were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 and had already received the first dose of mRNA-1273 2 to 4 weeks prior to participating in the study. The participants were asked to provide basic demographic characteristics (age, sex, medical history, allergy, medication, and mean sleep duration), the number of days after the first dose of vaccination, and the time of day of vaccination. Blood was collected from the participants, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were measured. Ordinary least square regression was used for assessing the relationship between basic demographic characteristics, number of days after vaccination, time of day of vaccination, and the log(10)-transformed normalized antibody titer. The least square mean of antibody titers was not associated with the vaccination time and sleep durations. The least square means of antibody titers was associated with age; the antibody titers decreased in people aged 50 to 59 years and 60 to 64 years. The present findings demonstrate that the vaccination time with mRNA-1273 was not associated with the SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer in an adult population, suggesting that these results do not support restricting vaccination to a particular time of day.

Based on luminescence resonance energy transfer processes, the intense lifetimes and representative emissions of PersL nanoplatforms were rationally manipulated to create a temporal coding dimension within a wide seconds-to-minutes range through three individual channels. Particularly, at least four populations of barcoding in a certain channel were successfully decoded by a purpose-built time-resolved PersL technology. As a proof-of-concept, functionalized PersL nanoplatforms were further well developed for the simultaneous quantification of five-plex SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers with limits of detection in the subnanomolar range.

The spread and severity of the outbreak took a heavy toll and overburdening of the global health system, particularly since there were no available drugs against SARS-CoV-2. With an immediate worldwide effort, communication, and sharing of data, large amounts of funding, researchers and pharmaceutical companies immediately fast-tracked vaccine development in order to prevent severe disease, hospitalizations and death. A number of vaccines were quickly approved for emergency use, and worldwide vaccination rollouts were immediately put in place. However, due to several individuals being hesitant to vaccinations and many poorer countries not having access to vaccines, multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants quickly emerged that were distinct from the original variant. Uncertainties related to the effectiveness of the various vaccines against the new variants as well as vaccine specific-side effects have remained a concern. Despite these uncertainties, fast-track vaccine approval, manufacturing at large scale, and the effective distribution of COVID-19 vaccines remain the topmost priorities around the world. Unprecedented efforts made by vaccine developers/researchers as well as healthcare staff, played a major role in distributing vaccine shots that provided protection and/or reduced disease severity, and deaths, even with the delta and omicron variants.

A wide range of hepato-biliary manifestations, including the infrequent and chronic manifestation of cholangiopathy, has been observed in COVID-19. The pathogenesis of liver injury is multifactorial and with scant evidence for a direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the liver. Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer are potentially at increased risk for severe COVID-19, and there are unique considerations in chronic hepatitis B or C, hepatocellular carcinoma, and in those immunosuppressed such as autoimmune hepatitis or liver transplant recipients. With the surges in SARS-CoV-2 infection, liver transplant activity has variably been impacted. Preliminarily, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines appear to be safe in those with chronic liver disease and in transplant recipients, while emerging data suggest the need for a third dose in immunosuppressed patients.

This results in a high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and developing coronavuris disease 2019, with excess mortality due to disease burden and immunosuppression. We determined the efficacy of a 100-microg booster of mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) 6 months after two doses of BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, USA) in 194 SARS-CoV-2-naive dialysis patients. METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies were measured with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2 as well as 4 weeks after the mRNA-1273 booster. The presence of neutralizing antibodies was measured by the SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (GenScript Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Two different cut-offs for positivity were used, one according to the manufacturer's specifications and one correlating with positivity in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Receiver operating characteristics analyses were performed to match the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody cut-offs with the cut-offs in the surrogate neutralization assay accordingly. RESULTS: Any level of immunoreactivity determined by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody assay was found in 87.3% (n = 144/165) and 90.6% (n = 164/181) of patients 4 and 10-12 weeks, respectively, after two doses of BNT162b2. This was reduced to 68.5% or 60.6% 4 weeks and 51.7% or 35.4% 10-12 weeks, respectively, when using the ROC cut-offs for neutralizing antibodies in the surrogate neutralization test (manufacturer's cut-off >/=103 U/mL and cut-off correlating with PRNT >/=196 U/mL). Four weeks after the mRNA-1273 booster, the concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies increased to 23 119.9 U/mL and to 97.3% for both cut-offs of neutralizing antibodies. CONCLUSION: Two doses of BNT162b2 followed by one dose of mRNA-1273 within 6 months in patients receiving maintenance dialysis resulted in significant titres of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies. While two doses of mRNA vaccine achieved adequate humoral immunity in a minority, the third vaccination boosts the development of virus-neutralizing quantities of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies (against wild-type SARS-CoV-2) in almost all patients.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35099023/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/6517745 https://sci-hub.do/gfac018 https://sci-hub.do/10.1093/ndt/gfac018", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.9649283828295971}, {"uid": 36573824, "aid": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03700", "titl": "Bioinspired Plasmo-virus for Point-of-Care SARS-CoV-2 Detection.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis;;; Point-of-Care Systems;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Limit of Detection", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Park, Younggeun; Ryu, Byunghoon; Ki, Seung Jun; Chen, Mingze; Liang, Xiaogan; Kurabayashi, Katsuo", "jour": "Nano letters", "affl": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.;;; Weil Institute for Critical Care Research and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.;;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.;;; Department of Mechanical Engineerng, Inha Univeristy, Incheon 22212, Republic of Korea.;;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.;;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.;;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.;;; Weil Institute for Critical Care Research and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.;;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.;;; Weil Institute for Critical Care Research and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.;;; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.", "pdat": "2023 Jan 11", "tiab": "Directly identifying the presence of the virus in infected hosts with an appropriate speed and sensitivity permits early epidemic management even during the presymptomatic incubation period of infection.

Our single center experience describes the patient profile and disease evolution observed in this vulnerable group after inoculation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study with kidney transplant patients who received a COVID-19 vaccine before testing positive for SARS-CoV-19 using polymerase chain reaction. Demographic characteristics and clinical information are described and compared with our previous series of patients who were infected before the initiation of the vaccination rollout. RESULTS: Sixteen kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 after being vaccinated were included and compared with our previous series of 76 unvaccinated patients who were positive for COVID-19. No differences were found among risk factors such as age, time after transplant, hypertension, and obesity between groups (P value > .05). After COVID-19 diagnosis among inoculated patients, 10 patients were hospitalized, and 4 of who met the criteria for admission to the intensive care unit. Three patients died of COVID-19 complications. Despite this, the incidence of infections has decreased after vaccination rollout (P value < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients' risk profiles remain constant among recipients who were positive for COVID-19 between waves.

METHODS: In this cohort study, we included public sector patients aged >/=20 years with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 14 November and 11 December 2021 (wave four) and equivalent prior wave periods. We compared the risk between waves of the following outcomes using Cox regression: death, severe hospitalisation or death and any hospitalisation or death (all </=14 days after diagnosis) adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, geography, vaccination and prior infection. RESULTS: We included 5144 patients from wave four and 11,609 from prior waves. The risk of all outcomes was lower in wave four compared to the Delta-driven wave three (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for death 0.27 [0.19; 0.38]. Risk reduction was lower when adjusting for vaccination and prior diagnosed infection (aHR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.29; 0.59) and reduced further when accounting for unascertained prior infections (aHR: 0.72). Vaccine protection was maintained in wave four (aHR for outcome of death: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.10; 0.58).

Materials and Methods: We analyzed 144 SOT recipients who had previously received two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA1273 vaccine, and who were subsequently vaccinated with a booster dose of the mRNA1273 vaccine. Humoral and cellular immune responses were measured 1 and 3 months after the second dose, and 1 month after the third dose. Results: One month after the second dose, 33.6% (45/134) of patients displayed a positive antibody response with a median (25th, 75th) antibody titer of 9 (7, 161) AU/mL. Three months after the second dose, 41.8% (56/134) tested positive with a median (25th, 75th) antibody titer of 18 (7, 251) AU/mL. After the booster dose, the seropositivity rate increased to 69.4% (93/134), with a median (25th, 75th) titer of 966 (10, 8027) AU/mL. The specific SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was assessed in 44 randomly selected recipients 3 months after the second dose, and 11.4% (5/44) of them had a positive response. Following the third dose, 42% (21/50) tested positive. Side effects after the third dose were mild, with pain at the injection site being the most frequent adverse effect, reported by 73.4% of the recipients. Conclusion: Our study shows a mild delayed increase in antibody titer, three months after primary vaccination compared to one month after. It also shows a robust augmentation of humoral and specific T-cell responses after the booster dose, as well as the safety and tolerability of the mRNA vaccines in SOT recipients.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37374279/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/medicina59061075 https://sci-hub.do/medicina-59-01075 https://sci-hub.do/10.3390/medicina59061075", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 11, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 33779533, "aid": "S0899823X21001070 10.1017/ice.2021.107", "titl": "Mass severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing of asymptomatic healthcare personnel - ERRATUM.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;;

However, its impact on the risk of breakthrough infection (BI) has yet to be assessed. METHODS: Single-center prospective longitudinal cohort study enrolling adult SOT recipients who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during a 1-year period (February 2021 - January 2022), end of follow-up April 2022. Patients were tested for AbR at multiple time points. The primary end-point was BI (laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection >/=14 days after the second dose). Immunization (positive AbR) was considered an intermediate state between vaccination and BI. Probabilities of being in vaccination, immunization, and BI states were obtained for each type of graft and vaccination sequence using multistate survival analysis. Then, multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze the risk of BI related to AbR levels. RESULTS: 614 SOT (275 kidney, 163 liver, 137 heart, 39 lung) recipients were included. Most patients (84.7%) received 3 vaccine doses. The first 2 consisted of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in 73.5% and 26.5% of cases, respectively. For the third dose, mRNA-1273 was administered in 59.8% of patients. Overall, 75.4% of patients reached immunization and 18.4% developed BI. Heart transplant recipients showed the lowest probability of immunization (0.418) and the highest of BI (0.323); all mRNA-1273 vaccine sequences showed the highest probability of immunization (0.732) and the lowest of BI (0.098). Risk of BI was higher for non-high-level AbR, younger age, and shorter time from transplant.

We assessed clinical performance and ease-of-use of seven Ag-RDTs in a prospective, manufacturer-independent, multi-centre cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study to inform global decision makers. METHODS: Unvaccinated participants suspected of a first SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited at six sites (Germany, Brazil). Ag-RDTs were evaluated sequentially, with collection of paired swabs for routine reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and Ag-RDT testing. Performance was compared to RT-PCR overall and in sub-group analyses (viral load, symptoms, symptoms duration). To understandusability a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use (EoU) assessment were performed. FINDINGS: 7471 participants were included in the analysis. Sensitivities across Ag-RDTs ranged from 70.4%-90.1%, specificities were above 97.2% for all Ag-RDTs but one (93.1%).Ag-RDTs, Mologic, Bionote, Standard Q, showed diagnostic accuracy in line with WHO targets (> 80% sensitivity, > 97% specificity). All tests showed high sensitivity in the first three days after symptom onset (>/=87.1%) and in individuals with viral loads>/= 6 log(10)SARS-CoV2 RNA copies/mL (>/= 88.7%). Usability varied, with Rapigen, Bionote and Standard Q reaching very good scores; 90, 88 and 84/100, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Variability in test performance is partially explained by variable viral loads in population evaluated over the course of the pandemic. All Ag-RDTs reach high sensitivity early in the disease and in individuals with high viral loads, supporting their role in identifying transmission relevant infections. For easy-to-use tests, performance shown will likely be maintained in routine implementation.

The effectiveness of a second vaccine dose in this group in the Omicron era is unknown. METHODS: We linked nationwide population registries in Spain to identify community-dwelling individuals aged 18-64, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test before single-dose mRNA vaccination (mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2). Every day between 3 January and 6 February 2022 we matched 1:1 individuals receiving a second mRNA vaccine dose and controls on sex, age, province, first dose type and time, month of primary infection, and number of previous tests. We then estimated Kaplan-Meier risks of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We performed a similar analysis in a Delta-dominant period, between 19 July and 30 November 2021. RESULTS: In the Omicron period, estimated effectiveness (95% CI) of a second dose was 62.2% (58.2-66.4%) 7-34 days after administration, similar across groups defined by age, sex, type of first vaccine, and time since the first dose. Estimated effectiveness was 65.4% (61.1-69.9%) for mRNA-1273 and 52.0% (41.8-63.1%) for BNT162b2. Estimated effectiveness was 78.5% (67.4-89.9%), 66.1% (54.9-77.5%), and 60.2% (55.5-64.8%) when primary infection had occurred in the Delta, Alpha, and pre-Alpha periods, respectively. In the Delta period, the estimated effectiveness of a second dose was 8.8% (-55.3% to 81.1%).

Among the organs affected since the beginning of the pandemic, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and thyroid involvement has been demonstrated. Novel and highly effective messenger RNA and DNA-based vaccines have been rapidly developed to decrease SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality. Early after mass vaccinations, cases of thyroid dysfunction mainly including episodes of subacute thyroiditis, began to be reported like adverse effects. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of the pandemic, both due to SARS-CoV2 infections and vaccinations, on the incidence of Graves' disease (GD). METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational study comparing incidence of GD in adult population (over 18 years) before (2017-2019) and after (2020-2021) Covid-19 pandemic. Only patients with new cases of GD, no relapsed diseases, were included. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was based on nucleic acid amplification tests on nasopharyngeal swabs or measurement of class M and class G antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by highly specific assays. Data on incidence and vaccination related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from the public records from Castilla y Leon autonomous regional government. RESULTS: A total of 180 subjects were diagnosed and treated for GD during the study period. We observed a notable increase in expected GD cases in 2021 compared to 2017-19. The number of GD cases was higher in the second (Q2) quarter. Among 2021 GD cases, 42/66 patients (63.6%) had been vaccinated in the 90 days before symptom onset, but none of them in the first quarter of the year. A total of 97.7% were women with a mean age of 48.9 (SD 15.6) years. On average they were diagnosed 19.9 (SD 17.6) days after receiving the vaccine. A total of 7/42 (16.67%) had another previously diagnosed autoimmune disease and 11/42 (26.19%) were smokers. DISCUSSION: Our results show a notable increase in the incidence of GD during the year 2021, specially in women with a history of smoking. Hyper activation of the immune system induced by SARS-CoV2 and by the recently released SARS-COV-2 vaccines has been highlighted in recent months. To assess whether this observed increase in the incidence of GD is sustained in the coming years or has simply been a precipitous trigger for individuals who were already predisposed to develop the disease, future studies will be needed.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36510647/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/CEN14860 https://sci-hub.do/10.1111/cen.14860", "pt": "Journal Article; Observational Study", "pl": "England", "topic": 3, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35315712, "aid": "02715-21 spectrum.02715-21 10.1128/spectrum.02715-21", "titl": "Longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 Testing among the Unvaccinated Is Punctuated by Intermittent Positivity and Variable Rates of Increasing Cycle Threshold Values.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Humans;;; RNA;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; *COVID-19 Drug Treatment", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Hawken, Shawn E; Sellers, Subhashini A; Smedberg, Jason R; Ward, Jeremy D; Elliott, Avian M; Whinna, Herbert C; Fischer, William A; Miller, Melissa B", "jour": "Microbiology spectrum", "affl": "Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, McLendon Clinical Laboratories, UNC Medical Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillgrid.10698.36, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, McLendon Clinical Laboratories, UNC Medical Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillgrid.10698.36, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, McLendon Clinical Laboratories, UNC Medical Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillgrid.10698.36, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillgrid.10698.36, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, McLendon Clinical Laboratories, UNC Medical Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillgrid.10698.36, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Apr 27", "tiab": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is complicated by cases of vaccine breakthrough and reinfection and widespread transmission of variants of concern (VOCs). Consequently, the need to interpret longitudinal positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests is crucial in guiding clinical decisions regarding infection control precautions and treatment. Although diagnostic real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR tests yield C(T) values that are inversely correlated with RNA quantity, these tests are only approved for qualitative interpretation. In this study, we performed a retrospective review of 72,217 SARS-CoV-2 positive tests and identified 264 patients with longitudinal positivity prior to vaccination and VOC circulation. Patients with longitudinal positivity fell into two categories: short-term (207, 78%) or prolonged (57, 22%) positivity, defined as </=28 (range, 1 to 28; median, 16) days and >28 (range, 29 to 152; median, 41) days, respectively. In general, C(T) values increased over time in both groups; however, 11 short-term-positive patients had greater amounts of RNA detected at their terminal test than at the first positive test, and 6 patients had RNA detected at C(T) values of <35 at least 40 days after initial infection. Oscillating positive and negative results occurred in both groups, although oscillation was seen three times more frequently in prolonged-positive patients. Patients with prolonged positivity had diverse clinical characteristics but were often critically ill and were discharged to high-level care or deceased (22%). Overall, this study demonstrates that caution must be emphasized when interpreting C(T) values as a proxy for infectivity, a predictor of severity, or a guide for patient care decisions in the absence of additional clinical context, particularly among the unvaccinated population.

We aimed to estimate protection against symptomatic PCR-confirmed infection with the delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants in adolescents with previous infection, mRNA vaccination, and hybrid immunity. METHODS: We conducted an observational, test-negative, case-control study using national SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination data in England. Symptomatic adolescents aged 12-17 years who were unvaccinated or had received primary BNT162b2 immunisation at symptom onset and had a community SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were included. Vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status in adolescents with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (cases) were compared with vaccination and previous infection status in adolescents who had a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (controls). Vaccination data were collected from the National Immunisation Management System, and were linked to PCR testing data. The primary outcome was protection against SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron infection (defined as 1 - odds of vaccination or previous infection in cases divided by odds of vaccination or previous infection in controls). FINDINGS: Between Aug 9, 2021, and March 31, 2022, 1 161 704 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were linked to COVID-19 vaccination status, including 390 467 positive tests with the delta variant and 212 433 positive tests with the omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2. In unvaccinated adolescents, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with wildtype, alpha (B.1.1.7), or delta strains provided greater protection against subsequent delta infection (>86.1%) than against subsequent omicron infection (<52.4%); previous delta or omicron infection provided similar protection against omicron reinfection (52.4% [95% CI 50.9-53.8] vs 59.3% [46.7-69.0]). In adolescents with no previous infection, vaccination provided lower protection against omicron infection than against delta infection, with omicron protection peaking at 64.5% (95% CI 63.6-65.4) at 2-14 weeks after dose two and 62.9% (60.5-65.1) at 2-14 weeks after dose three, with waning protection after each dose. Adolescents with hybrid immunity from previous infection and vaccination had the highest protection, irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 strain in the primary infection. The highest protection against omicron infection was observed in adolescents with vaccination and previous omicron infection, reaching 96.4% (95% CI 84.4-99.1) at 15-24 weeks after vaccine dose two. INTERPRETATION: Previous infection with any SARS-CoV-2 variant provided some protection against symptomatic reinfection, and vaccination added to this protection.

These immunological parameters in homologous or heterologous vaccination boosts have thus far been studied for mRNA and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines, but knowledge on individuals who received a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is lacking. METHODS: We studied Spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated individuals (n = 55) who were either primed with Ad26.COV2.S only (n = 13) or were boosted with a homologous (Ad26.COV2.S, n = 28) or heterologous (BNT162b2, n = 14) second dose. We compared our findings with the results found in individuals vaccinated with a single (n = 16) or double (n = 44) dose of BNT162b2. FINDINGS: We observed that a strategy of heterologous vaccination enhanced the quantity and breadth of both Spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated individuals. In contrast, the impact of the homologous boost was quantitatively minimal in Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated individuals, and Spike-specific antibodies and T cells were narrowly focused to the S1 region. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small sample size of the study and the lack of well-defined correlates of protection against COVID-19, the immunological features detected support the utilization of a heterologous vaccine boost in individuals who received Ad26.COV2.S vaccination.

With many RDT products entering the market, it is important to rapidly evaluate their relative performance. Comparison of clinical evaluation study results is challenged by protocol design variations and study populations. Laboratory assays were developed to quantify nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Quantification of the two antigens in nasal eluates confirmed higher abundance of N than S antigen. The median concentration of N antigen was 10 times greater than S per genome equivalent. The N antigen assay was used in combination with quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to qualify a panel composed of recombinant antigens, inactivated virus, and clinical specimen pools. This benchmarking panel was applied to evaluate the analytical performance of the SD Biosensor Standard Q COVID-19 antigen (Ag) test, Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag rapid test, Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag test, and the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag test. The four tests displayed different sensitivities toward the different panel members, but all performed best with the clinical specimen pool. The concentration for a 90% probability of detection across the four tests ranged from 21 to 102 pg/mL of N antigen in the extracted sample. Benchmarking panels provide a quick way to verify the baseline performance of a diagnostic and enable direct comparisons between diagnostic tests. IMPORTANCE This study reports the results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) antigen quantification assays and their performance against clinical reverse transcription (RT)-PCR results, thus describing an open-access quantification method for two important SARS-CoV-2 protein analytes. Characterized N antigen panels were used to evaluate the limits of detection of four different rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 against multiple sources of nucleocapsid antigen, demonstrating proof-of-concept materials and methodology to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection tests. Quantification of N antigen was used to characterize the relationship between viral count and antigen concentration among clinical samples and panel members of both clinical sample and viral culture origin. This contributes to a deeper understanding of protein antigen and molecular analytes and presents analytical methods complementary to clinical evaluation for characterizing the performance of both laboratory-based and point-of-care rapid diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37166329/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/03731-22 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.03731-22 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.03731-22", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 0.9717832903838466}, {"uid": 36737101, "aid": "22-1367 10.3201/eid2903.221367", "titl": "Comparative Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines in Preventing Infections and Disease Progression from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 and BA.2, Portugal.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Portugal;;; *COVID-19;;; Cohort Studies;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Disease Progression", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Kislaya, Irina; Casaca, Pedro; Borges, Vitor; Sousa, Carlos; Ferreira, Bibiana I; Fonte, Ana; Fernandes, Eugenia; Dias, Carlos Matias; Duarte, Silvia; Almeida, Jose Pedro; Grenho, Ines; Coelho, Luis; Ferreira, Rita; Ferreira, Patricia Pita; Borges, Claudia Medeiros; Isidro, Joana; Pinto, Miguel; Menezes, Luis; Sobral, Daniel; Nunes, Alexandra; Santos, Daniela; Goncalves, Antonio Maia; Vieira, Luis; Gomes, Joao Paulo; Leite, Pedro Pinto; Nunes, Baltazar; Machado, Ausenda; Peralta-Santos, Andre", "jour": "Emerging infectious diseases", "affl": "\u0431\u0435\u0437 AD", "pdat": "2023 Mar", "tiab": "We estimated comparative primary and booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 and BA.2 lineages against infection and disease progression.

(2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations or using different sampling methods. RESULTS: 38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test. For antibody tests, 10 studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally, we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases.

With more than 266 million confirmed cases, over 5.26 million deaths already recorded at the time of writing, COVID-19 continues to spread in many parts of the world. Consequently, mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 will remain at the forefront of the COVID-19 response and prevention for the near future. Due to biosafety considerations the standard testing process requires a significant amount of manual handling of patient samples within calibrated microbiological safety cabinets. This makes the process expensive, effects operator ergonomics and restricts testing to higher containment level laboratories. We have successfully modified the process by using industrial catering ovens for bulk heat inactivation of oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab samples within their secondary containment packaging before processing in the lab to enable all subsequent activities to be performed in the open laboratory. As part of a validation process, we tested greater than 1200 clinical COVID-19 samples and showed less than 1 Cq loss in RT-qPCR test sensitivity. We also demonstrate the bulk heat inactivation protocol inactivates a murine surrogate of human SARS-CoV-2. Using bulk heat inactivation, the assay is no longer reliant on containment level 2 facilities and practices, which reduces cost, improves operator safety and ergonomics and makes the process scalable. In addition, heating as the sole method of virus inactivation is ideally suited to streamlined and more rapid workflows such as 'direct to PCR' assays that do not involve RNA extraction or chemical neutralisation methods.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35190592/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41598-022-06888-z https://sci-hub.do/6888 https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41598-022-06888-z", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Validation Study", "pl": "England", "topic": 1, "prop": 0.8853407482437562}, {"uid": 36593297, "aid": "10.1038/s41564-022-01272-z 10.1038/s41564-022-01272-z", "titl": "Comparative effectiveness of third doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in US veterans.", "mesh": "Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; 2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; *Veterans;;; RNA, Messenger/genetics", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Dickerman, Barbra A; Gerlovin, Hanna; Madenci, Arin L; Figueroa Muniz, Michael J; Wise, Jessica K; Adhikari, Nimish; Ferolito, Brian R; Kurgansky, Katherine E; Gagnon, David R; Cho, Kelly; Casas, Juan P; Hernan, Miguel A", "jour": "Nature microbiology", "affl": "CAUSALab, Harvard T.H.

Blood samples were tested for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain antibodies about 2 months after the first and second doses using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay kits. Adverse events were noted using an online self-reporting questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the 232 HCWs, pain (85.78% after the first dose vs. 58.62% after the second dose, p<0.001) was the most prominent local reaction, and myalgia or fatigue (84.05% vs. 53.02%, p<0.001) was the most prominent systemic reaction. The frequency of all adverse events was significantly reduced after the second dose. After the first dose, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S showed significantly higher titer in the group with swelling, itching, fever, and nausea. Also, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S titer significantly increased as the grade of fever (p=0.007) and duration of fever (p=0.026) increased; however, there was no significant correlation between immunogenicity and adverse event after the second dose. The group with pain after the first dose showed a greater increase in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S difference between the second and first doses compared to the group without pain (542.2 U/mL vs. 363.8 U/mL, p=0.037).

In this open observational study conducted in Lower Saxony, Germany, voluntary SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed from April 2020 until June 2021, supported by serum antibody testing to prove whether PCR testing in subjects with none or few symptoms of COVID-19 is a suitable tool to manage the pandemic. In different mobile stations, 4,817 subjects from three different working fields participated in the PCR testing. Serum antibody screening using the SARS-CoV-2 ViraChip IgG (Viramed, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche, Germany) was performed alongside virus neutralization testing. Subjects were questioned regarding comorbidities and COVID-19 symptoms. Fifty-one subjects with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected of which 31 subjects did not show any symptoms possibly characteristic for COVID-19. An additional 37 subjects reported a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (total prevalence 1.82%). Seroconversion was discovered in 58 subjects with known SARS-CoV-2 infection and in 58 subjects that never had a positive PCR test. The latter had a significantly lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, and one third of them were asymptomatic. In 50% of all seroconverted subjects, neutralizing serum antibodies (NAbs) were detectable in parallel to N/S1 (n = 16) or N/S1/S2 antigen specific antibodies (n = 40) against SARS-CoV-2. NAb titers decreased within 100 days after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 acute infection by at least 2.5-fold. A relatively high rate of subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that in addition to other intervention strategies, systematic screening of asymptomatic persons by PCR testing may significantly enable better pandemic control. IMPORTANCE Within this open observational study, repeated PCR (n > 4,700) and antibody screening (n > 1,600) tests were offered in three different working fields. The study identified 51 subjects with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and 37 subjects reported to have had a positive PCR test taken externally. Thirty-one of the 51 subjects did not display any symptoms prior to testing. In addition, 58 subjects without PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified by seroconversion. Subjects, that had undergone SARS-CoV-2 infection without having noticed, more often had a low grade of immunization with no NAbs, but may have relevantly contributed to the spread of the pandemic. Based on these results, we suggest that both regular PCR and rapid test screening of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, specifically within groups or workplaces identifiable as having close quarter contact, thus increased infection transference risk, is necessary to better assess and therefore reduce the spread of a pandemic virus.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35171028/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/01512-21 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.01512-21 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.01512-21", "pt": "Journal Article; Observational Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 5, "prop": 0.7550774026505279}, {"uid": 34382507, "aid": "CCHTS-EPUB-117273 10.2174/1386207324666210811124856", "titl": "High Throughput Screening for Drug Discovery and Virus Detection.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Drug Discovery;;; High-Throughput Screening Assays/methods;;; Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19 Drug Treatment", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Oke, Adetola; Sahin, Deniz; Chen, Xin; Shang, Ying", "jour": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "affl": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, USA.;;; Department of Innovation Management, Entrepreneurship and Sustainability, Technische Universitat Berlin, Germany.;;; Department of Industrial Engineering, Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, USA.;;; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indiana Institute of Technology, Fort Wayne, USA.", "pdat": "2022", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: High throughput screening systems are automated labs for the analysis of many biochemical substances in the drug discovery and virus detection process. This paper was motivated by the problem of automating testing for viruses and new drugs using high throughput screening systems. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) at the turn of 2019-2020 presented extraordinary challenges to public health. Existing approaches to test viruses and new drugs do not use optimal schedules and are not efficient. OBJECTIVES: The scheduling of activities performed by various resources in a high throughput screening system affects its efficiency, throughput, operations cost, and quality of screening. This study aims to minimize the total screening (flow) time and ensure the consistency and quality of screening. METHODS: This paper develops innovative mixed-integer models that efficiently compute optimal schedules for screening many microplates to identify new drugs and determine whether samples contain viruses. The methods integrate job-shop and cyclic scheduling. Experiments are conducted for a drug discovery process of screening an enzymatic assay and a general process of detecting SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The method developed in this article can reduce screening time by as much as 91.67%. CONCLUSION: The optimal schedules for high throughput screening systems greatly reduce the total flow time and can be computed efficiently to help discover new drugs and detect viruses.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34382507/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/CCHTS-EPUB-117273 https://sci-hub.do/10.2174/1386207324666210811124856", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United Arab Emirates", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 35637389, "aid": "10.1038/s41551-022-00889-z 10.1038/s41551-022-00889-z", "titl": "Simplified Cas13-based assays for the fast identification of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis/virology;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; CRISPR-Associated Proteins;;; Humans;;; *Nucleic Acids;;; SARS-CoV-2/classification/genetics/isolation & purification", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Arizti-Sanz, Jon; Bradley, A'Doriann; Zhang, Yibin B; Boehm, Chloe K; Freije, Catherine A; Grunberg, Michelle E; Kosoko-Thoroddsen, Tinna-Solveig F; Welch, Nicole L; Pillai, Priya P; Mantena, Sreekar; Kim, Gaeun; Uwanibe, Jessica N; John, Oluwagboadurami G; Eromon, Philomena E; Kocher, Gregory; Gross, Robin; Lee, Justin S; Hensley, Lisa E; MacInnis, Bronwyn L; Johnson, Jeremy; Springer, Michael; Happi, Christian T; Sabeti, Pardis C; Myhrvold, Cameron", "jour": "Nature biomedical engineering", "affl": "Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Program in Virology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.;;; African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), Redeemer's University, Ede, Osun State, Nigeria.;;; Department of Biological Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, Redeemer's University, Ede, Osun State, Nigeria.;;; Department of Biological Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, Redeemer's University, Ede, Osun State, Nigeria.;;; African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), Redeemer's University, Ede, Osun State, Nigeria.;;; Integrated Research Facility, Division of Clinical Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health, Frederick, MD, USA.;;; Integrated Research Facility, Division of Clinical Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health, Frederick, MD, USA.;;; Biotechnology Cores Facility Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, National Center for Emerging and Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.;;; Integrated Research Facility, Division of Clinical Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health, Frederick, MD, USA.;;; Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.;;; Harvard T.H.

As of January 2022 WHO statistics shows more than 5.6 million death and about 350 million infection by SARS-CoV-2. One of the life threatening aspects of COVID-19 is secondary infections and reduced efficacy of antibiotics against them. Since the beginning of COVID-19 many researches have been done on identification, treatment, and vaccine development. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) could offer novel approaches to detect, treat and control COVID-19. Phage therapy and in particular using phage cocktails can be used to control or eliminate the bacterial pathogen as an alternative or complementary therapeutic agent. At the same time, phage interaction with the host immune system can regulate the inflammatory response. In addition, phage display and engineered synthetic phages can be utilized to develop new vaccines and antibodies, stimulate the immune system, and elicit a rapid and well-appropriate defense response. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 new variants like delta and omicron has proved the urgent need for precise, efficient and novel approaches for vaccine development and virus detection techniques in which bacteriophages may be one of the plausible solutions. Therefore, phages with similar morphology and/or genetic content to that of coronaviruses can be used for ecological and epidemiological modeling of SARS-CoV-2 behavior and future generations of coronavirus, and in general new viral pathogens.

SARS-CoV-2 genomes were successfully generated for 11 of the vaccine breakthroughs, and 878 individuals in the surrounding area and were included for reference-based phylogenetic investigation.

In this study, we sought to investigate the value of serum SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag for COVID-19 diagnosis and to analyze N-Ag characteristics in COVID-19 individuals. METHODS: Serum samples collected from 215 COVID-19 patients and 65 non-COVID-19 individuals were used to quantitatively detect N-Ag via chemiluminescent immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the N-Ag assay were 64.75% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) [55.94-72.66%]) and 100% (95% CI [93.05-100.00%]), respectively, according to the cut-off value recommended by the manufacturer. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed a sensitivity of 100.00% (95% CI [94.42-100.00%]) and a specificity of 71.31% (95% CI [62.73-78.59%]). The positive rates and levels of serum SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag were not related to sex, comorbidity status or disease severity of COVID-19 (all P < 0.001). Compared with RT\u2012PCR, there was a lower positive rate of serum N-Ag for acute COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). The positive rate and levels of serum SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag in acute patients were significantly higher than those in convalescent patients (all P < 0.001). In addition, the positive rate of serum SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag in acute COVID-19 patients was higher than that of serum antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies (Nab)) against SARS-CoV-2 (all P < 0.001). However, the positive rate of serum SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag in convalescent COVID-19 patients was significantly lower than that of antibodies (all P < 0.001).

NAbs were quantified with the cPass SARS-CoV-2 kit. Individuals immunized with the Ad5-nCoV showed higher reactogenicity than those immunized with the other vaccines (p < 0.001). The BTN162b2 vaccine-induced NAbs with higher inhibition capacity than the other platforms in the first dose. In individuals without prior COVID-19, the Ad5-nCoV vaccine generated lower NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 than those induced by two doses of the BTN162b2 (Ad5-nCoV 72.10 [55.6-93.4] vs. BTN162b2 98.41 [98.16-98.56], p < 0.0001). One individual did not generate NAbs (0.89%) after a complete immunization with CoronaVac; in BTN162b2, all generated these antibodies, and in the Ad5-nCoV group, four individuals (3.57%) did not generate NAbs. Comorbidities, gender, age, and reactogenicity did not significantly influence the generation of NAbs (p > 0.05); however, a history of COVID-19 before vaccination was associated with antibodies with greater neutralizing capacity after the first dose (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the mRNA vaccine (BTN162b2) had a remarkable better ability to produce NAbs and lower reactogenicity than the other platforms, whereas the Ad5-nCov vaccine induced the lowest NAbs response in individuals without a history of COVID-19; therefore, we suggest that a booster could benefit these individuals.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36279685/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0165-2478(22)00141-9 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.imlet.2022.10.002", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Netherlands", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.9558969980990358}, {"uid": 35027756, "aid": "10.1038/s41591-021-01666-2 1666 10.1038/s41591-021-01666-2", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination rates in pregnant women in Scotland.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; COVID-19 Vaccines/therapeutic use;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Pregnancy;;; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; Pregnant Women;;; Prospective Studies;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccination", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Stock, Sarah J; Carruthers, Jade; Calvert, Clara; Denny, Cheryl; Donaghy, Jack; Goulding, Anna; Hopcroft, Lisa E M; Hopkins, Leanne; McLaughlin, Terry; Pan, Jiafeng; Shi, Ting; Taylor, Bob; Agrawal, Utkarsh; Auyeung, Bonnie; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; McCowan, Colin; Murray, Josie; Simpson, Colin R; Robertson, Chris; Vasileiou, Eleftheria; Sheikh, Aziz; Wood, Rachael", "jour": "Nature medicine", "affl": "University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK. sarah.stock@ed.ac.uk.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK. sarah.stock@ed.ac.uk.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; The DataLab, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.;;; School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; MRC/CSO Social & Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.;;; School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.;;; Institute of Health & Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; School of Health, Wellington Faculty of Health, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.;;; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; University of Edinburgh Usher Institute, Edinburgh, UK.;;; Public Health Scotland, Scotland, UK.", "pdat": "2022 Mar", "tiab": "Population-level data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes are lacking.

Despite all of the efforts, developing effective treatments, diagnostic techniques, and vaccinations for this unique virus is a top priority and takes a long time. However, the foremost step in vaccine development is to identify possible antigens for a vaccine. The traditional method was time taking, but after the breakthrough technology of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in 2000, it drastically lowers the time needed to detect antigens ranging from 5-15 years to 1-2 years. The different RV tools work based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Models based on AI and ML have shown promising solutions in accelerating the discovery and optimization of new antivirals or effective vaccine candidates. In the present scenario, AI has been extensively used for drug and vaccine research against SARS-COV-2 therapy discovery. This is more useful for the identification of potential existing drugs with inhibitory human coronavirus by using different datasets.

However, which combination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines offers the strongest immune response against the Omicron variant is unknown. METHODS: This randomized, participant-blinded, controlled trial assessed the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccine booster combinations. A total of 100 BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to either homologous (BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 + BNT162b2; \"BBB\") or heterologous messenger RNA (mRNA) (BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 + mRNA-1273; \"BBM\") booster vaccine. The primary end point was the level of neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wild-type and VOCs at day 28. RESULTS: A total of 51 participants were allocated to BBB and 49 to BBM; 50 and 48, respectively, were analyzed for safety and immunogenicity outcomes. At day 28 post-boost, mean SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers were lower with BBB (22 382 IU/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 18 210 to 27 517) vs BBM (29 751 IU/mL; 95% CI, 25 281 to 35 011; P = .034) as was the median level of neutralizing antibodies: BBB 99.0% (interquartile range [IQR], 97.9% to 99.3%) vs BBM 99.3% (IQR, 98.8% to 99.5%; P = .021). On subgroup analysis, significant higher mean spike antibody titer, median surrogate neutralizing antibody level against all VOCs, and live Omicron neutralization titer were observed only in older adults receiving BBM. Both vaccines were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Heterologous mRNA-1273 booster vaccination compared with homologous BNT123b2 induced a stronger neutralizing response against the Omicron variant in older individuals.

SARS-CoV-2 is mainly airborne, transmitted by the salivary droplets produced when infected people cough or sneeze. In addition, diarrhea symptoms and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in feces suggest a fecal-oral route of contagion. Currently, the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis has surpassed the availability of PCR and immunodetection probes and has prompted the development of other diagnostic alternatives. In this context, mass spectrometry (MS) represents a mature, robust alternative platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other human viruses. This possibility has raised great interest worldwide. Therefore, it is time for the global application of MS as a feasible option for detecting SARS-CoV-2, not only in human fluids, but also in other matrices such as foods and wastewater. This review covers the most relevant established methods for MS-based SARS-CoV-2 detection and discusses the future application of these tools in different matrices. Significance: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the pros and cons of currently available PCR and immunodetection tools. The great concern over the infective potential of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles that can persist for several hours on different surfaces under various conditions further evidenced the need for reliable alternatives and high-throughput methods to meet the needs for mass detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this context, MS-based proteomics emerging from fundamental studies in life science can offer a robust option for SARS-CoV-2 detection in human fluids and other matrices. In addition, the substantial efforts towards detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinal samples, position MS to support the detection of this virus in different matrices such as the surfaces of the packing food process, frozen foods, and wastewaters. Proteomics and mass spectrometry are, therefore, well positioned to play a role in the epidemiological control of COVID-19 and other future diseases.

This study aimed to estimate the serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and vaccination in children in Calgary, Alberta over a two-year period. METHODS: Children with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infections, were enrolled in Calgary, Canada in 2020. Venous blood was sampled 4 times from July 2020 to April 2022 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike antibodies. Demographic and clinical information was obtained including SARS-CoV-2 testing results and vaccination records. RESULTS: 1035 children were enrolled and 88.9% completed all 4 visits; median age 9 years (IQR: 5,13); 519 (50.1%) female; and 815 (78.7%) Caucasian. Before enrolment, 118 (11.4%) had confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2. By April 2022, 39.5% of previously uninfected participants had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nucleocapsid antibody seropositivity declined to 16.4% of all infected children after more than 200 days post diagnosis. Spike antibodies remained elevated in 93.6% of unvaccinated infected children after more than 200 days post diagnosis. By April 2022, 408 (95.6%) children 12 years and older had received 2 or more vaccine doses, and 241 (61.6%) 5 to 11 year-old children had received 2 vaccine doses. At that time, all 685 vaccinated children had spike antibodies, compared with 94/176 (53.4%) of unvaccinated children. CONCLUSIONS: In our population, after the first peak of Omicron variant infections and introduction of COVID-19 vaccines for children, all vaccinated children, but just over one-half of unvaccinated children, had SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies indicating infection and/or vaccination, highlighting the benefit of vaccination. It is not yet known whether a high proportion of seropositivity at the present time predicts sustained population-level protection against future SARS-CoV-2 transmission, infection or severe COVID-19 outcomes in children.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37023007/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/PONE-D-22-30832 https://sci-hub.do/10.1371/journal.pone.0284046", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 5, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35152299, "aid": "6527943 ciac129 10.1093/cid/ciac129", "titl": "Self-Assessed Severity as a Determinant of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Symptom Specificity: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Humans;;; Longitudinal Studies;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Bershteyn, Anna; Dahl, Angela M; Dong, Tracy Q; Deming, Meagan E; Celum, Connie L; Chu, Helen Y; Kottkamp, Angelica C; Greninger, Alexander L; Hoffman, Risa M; Jerome, Keith R; Johnston, Christine M; Kissinger, Patricia J; Landovitz, Raphael J; Laufer, Miriam K; Luk, Alfred; Neuzil, Kathleen M; Paasche-Orlow, Michael K; Pitts, Robert A; Schwartz, Mark D; Stankiewicz Karita, Helen C; Thorpe, Lorna E; Wald, Anna; Zheng, Crystal Y; Wener, Mark H; Barnabas, Ruanne V; Brown, Elizabeth R", "jour": "Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America", "affl": "Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.;;; Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;;; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.;;; Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.;;; International Clinical Research Center and Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;;; Department of Medicine and Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;;; Department of Medicine, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.;;; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.;;; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;;; Department of Medicine and Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.;;; Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.;;; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;;; Department of Medicine and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;;; Department of Epidemiology, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.;;; Center for Clinical AIDS Research & Education, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.;;; Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.;;; John W.

Among them, nine ssDNA-FQ reporters were found to be suitable for direct visual colorimetric detection, with especially very strong performance using ROX-labeled reporters. We optimized the reaction concentrations of these ssDNA-FQ reporters for a naked-eye read-out of assay results (no transducing component required for visualization). In particular, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm to standardize and automate the analytical colorimetric assessment of images and integrated this into the MagicEye mobile phone software.

METHODS: Individuals who presented at a COVID-19 testing facility affiliated with a Swiss university hospital were prospectively recruited (n=377). Saliva specimen was obtained, and the PCL Inc. COVID19 Gold antigen test was conducted in parallel with 2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays from a nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: RT-PCR results were positive in 53 individuals, corresponding to a prevalence of 14.1% (missing material in 1 individual). The PCL saliva antigen test was positive in 22 individuals (5.8%) and negative in 354 (93.9%). The sensitivity of the saliva antigen test was 30.2% (95% confidence interval 18.3, 44.3), both overall and in symptomatic individuals. The specificity was 98.1% (96.0, 99.3).

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with suspected COVID-19 who underwent NAAT between October 5, 2020, and May 31, 2021 in our institution. RESULTS: A total of 1238 patients were enrolled and NAAT positive results were observed in 40 patients (3.2%). The NAAT positivity rate was 34.3% (23/67) in patients with a history of close contact and 1.5% (17/1171) in patients without a history of close contact. Olfactory/gustatory dysfunction and a history of stay in other prefectures were independent risk factors of COVID-19 in patients without a history of close contact. On the other hand, the NAAT positivity rate was only 0.7% (8/1073) in patients without olfactory/gustatory dysfunction and a history of stay in other prefectures. Among them, the group without respiratory symptoms/sign had only one NAAT-positive case (0.1%: 1/1073). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that a history of close contact, olfactory/gustatory dysfunction, and a history of stay in other prefectures are key eligibility criteria for NAAT in areas with relatively few patients with COVID-19.

The selection of convalescent plasma donors (CPD) is commonly based on neutralizing antibody titer. A better understanding of the quality of immune responses following COVID-19 will enable the optimization of convalescent donors' selection in convalescent plasma programs. The involvement of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells in the induction and persistence of high affinity anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody is still poorly investigated. In this study, 115 CPD who presented SARS-CoV-2 and who were eligible for plasma donation were included. Comprehensive analysis of T cells together with humoral responses were performed in regards of sex, age and blood group type. High frequency of T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 related protein such as spike glycoprotein (80.0%), nucleocapsid (NCAP) (70.4%) and membrane protein (VME1) (74.8%) were detected in CPD by ex vivo IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha ELISpot assays. Among CPD responders, most exhibited poly-specific T cell responses (75%) defined by the ability to mount responses against at least two SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We found a positive correlation between the magnitude and the poly-specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses in CPD. Notably, both the magnitude and poly-specificity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses were highly correlated with neutralizing antibody titer in CPD. The present study highlights that the poly-specificity and strength of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses predicts neutralizing antibody titer following COVID-19.

METHODS: We measured IgM, IgA, and IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens in 1076 adults of a cohort study in Catalonia between June and November 2020 and a second time between May and July 2021. Questionnaire data and electronic health records on vaccination and COVID-19 testing were available in both periods. Data on several lifestyle, health-related, and sociodemographic characteristics were also available. RESULTS: Antibody seroreversion occurred in 35.8% of the 64 participants non-vaccinated and infected almost a year ago and was related to asymptomatic infection, age above 60 years, and smoking. Moreover, the analysis on kinetics revealed that among all responses, IgG RBD, IgA RBD, and IgG S2 decreased less within 1 year after infection. Among vaccinated, 2.1% did not present antibodies at the time of testing and approximately 1% had breakthrough infections post-vaccination. In the post-vaccination era, IgM responses and those against nucleoprotein were much less prevalent. In previously infected individuals, vaccination boosted the immune response and there was a slight but statistically significant increase in responses after a 2nd compared to the 1st dose. Infected vaccinated participants had superior antibody levels across time compared to naive-vaccinated people. mRNA vaccines and, particularly the Spikevax, induced higher antibodies after 1st and 2nd doses compared to Vaxzevria or Janssen COVID-19 vaccines. In multivariable regression analyses, antibody responses after vaccination were predicted by the type of vaccine, infection age, sex, smoking, and mental and cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that infected people would benefit from vaccination. Results also indicate that hybrid immunity results in superior antibody responses and infection-naive people would need a booster dose earlier than previously infected people.

Most Indigenous Peoples in Canada live in cities, where SARS-CoV-2 infection is concentrated. To address gaps in SARS-CoV-2 information for these urban populations, we partnered with Indigenous agencies and sought to generate rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination, and incidence of infection for First Nations, Inuit and Metis living in 2 Ontario cities. METHODS: We drew on existing cohorts of First Nations, Inuit and Metis adults in Toronto (n = 723) and London (n = 364), Ontario, who were recruited using respondent-driven sampling. We linked to ICES SARS-CoV-2 databases and prospectively monitored rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing, diagnosis and vaccination for First Nations, Inuit and Metis, and comparator city and Ontario populations. RESULTS: We found that SARS-CoV-2 testing rates among First Nations, Inuit and Metis were higher in Toronto (54.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 48.1% to 61.3%) and similar in London (44.5%, 95% CI 36.0% to 53.1%) compared with local and provincial rates. We determined that cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not significantly different among First Nations, Inuit and Metis in Toronto (7364/100 000, 95% CI 2882 to 11 847) or London (7707/100 000, 95% CI 2215 to 13 200) compared with city rates. We found that rates of vaccination among First Nations, Inuit and Metis in Toronto (58.2%, 95% CI 51.4% to 64.9%) and London (61.5%, 95% CI 52.9% to 70.0%) were lower than the rates for the 2 cities and Ontario. INTERPRETATION: Although Ontario government policies prioritized Indigenous populations for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, vaccine uptake was lower than in the general population for First Nations, Inuit and Metis Peoples in Toronto and London. Ongoing access to culturally safe testing and vaccinations is urgently required to avoid disproportionate hospital admisson and mortality related to COVID-19 in these communities.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35918087/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/194/29/E1018 https://sci-hub.do/194e1018 https://sci-hub.do/10.1503/cmaj.212147", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Canada", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 37081876, "aid": "10.3389/fimmu.2023.1157263", "titl": "Decreased breadth of the antibody response to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 after repeated vaccination.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; Antibody Formation;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus;;; Vaccination;;; Antibodies", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Horndler, Lydia; Delgado, Pilar; Romero-Pinedo, Salvador; Quesada, Marina; Balabanov, Ivaylo; Laguna-Goya, Rocio; Almendro-Vazquez, Patricia; Llamas, Miguel A; Fresno, Manuel; Paz-Artal, Estela; van Santen, Hisse M; Alvarez-Fernandez, Stela; Olmo, Asuncion; Alarcon, Balbino", "jour": "Frontiers in immunology", "affl": "Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;;; Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;;; VITRO SA, Granada, Spain.;;; VITRO SA, Granada, Spain.;;; Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;;; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Madrid, Spain.;;; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Madrid, Spain.;;; Empireo Diagnostico Molecular, Madrid, Spain.;;; Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;;; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Madrid, Spain.;;; Department of Immunology, Ophthalmology and ENT, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;;; Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;;; VITRO SA, Granada, Spain.;;; VITRO SA, Granada, Spain.;;; Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.", "pdat": "2023", "tiab": "INTRODUCTION: The rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 has raised the need to compare the capacity of different vaccines in terms of developing a protective humoral response. Previous studies have shown inconsistent results in this area, highlighting the importance of further research to evaluate the efficacy of different vaccines. METHODS: This study utilized a highly sensitive and reliable flow cytometry method to measure the titers of IgG1 isotype antibodies in the blood of healthy volunteers after receiving one or two doses of various vaccines administered in Spain. The method was also used to simultaneously measure the reactivity of antibodies to the S protein of the original Wuhan strain and variants B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B.1.617.1 (Kappa). RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the titer of anti-S antibodies produced after a first dose of the vaccines ChAdOx1 nCov-19/AstraZeneca, mRNA-1273/Moderna, BNT162b2/Pfizer-BioNTech, and Ad26.COV.S/Janssen. Furthermore, a relative reduction in the reactivity of the sera with the Alpha, Delta, and Kappa variants, compared to the Wuhan strain, was observed after the second boosting immunization. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study provide a comparison of different vaccines in terms of anti-S antibody generation and cast doubts on the convenience of repeated immunization with the same S protein sequence. The multiplexed capacity of the flow cytometry method utilized in this study allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of various vaccines in generating a protective humoral response.

There is an urgent need to address the impact of immunosuppression on vaccine immunogenicity. METHODS: Serological, T-cell ELISpot, cytokines and immunophenotyping were used to assess vaccine responses (either BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in double-vaccinated patients receiving immunosuppression for renal transplants or haematological malignancies (n = 13). Immunological responses in immunosuppressed patients (VACC-IS) were compared to immunocompetent vaccinated (VACC-IC, n = 12), unvaccinated (UNVACC, n = 11) and infection-naive unvaccinated (HC, n = 3) cohorts. RESULTS: No significant different differences in T-cell responses were observed between VACC-IS and VACC-IC (92%) to spike-peptide (S) stimulation. UNVACC had the highest T-cell non-responders (n = 3), whereas VACC-IC and VACC-IS both had one T-cell non-responder. No significant differences in humoral responses were observed between VACC-IC and VACC-IS, with 92% (12/13) of VACC-IS patients demonstrating seropositivity. One VACC-IS failed to seroconvert, however had detectable T-cell responses. All VACC-IC participants were seropositive for anti-spike antibodies. VACC-IS and VACC-IC participants elicited strong Th1 cytokine response with immunodominance towards S-peptide. Differences in T-cell immunophenotyping were seen between VACC-IS and VACC-IC, with lower CD8(+) activation and T-effector memory phenotype observed in VACC-IS. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are immunogenic in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, with responses comparable to vaccinated immunocompetent participants. Lower humoral responses were seen in patients treated with B-cell depleting therapeutics, but with preserved T-cell responses. We suggest further work to correlate both protective immunity and longevity of these responses in both healthy and immunosuppressed patients.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35299038/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0008-8749(22)00025-9 https://sci-hub.do/104501 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.cellimm.2022.104501", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Netherlands", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.9132759628963879}, {"uid": 34508833, "aid": "S0272-6386(21)00833-7 10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.08.005", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Response After a Third Dose of the BNT162b2 Vaccine in Patients Receiving Maintenance Hemodialysis or Peritoneal Dialysis.", "mesh": "Aged;;; Antibody Formation;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Male;;; *Peritoneal Dialysis;;; Renal Dialysis;;; SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Bensouna, Ilias; Caudwell, Valerie; Kubab, Sabah; Acquaviva, Sandra; Pardon, Agathe; Vittoz, Nathalie; Bozman, Dogan-Firat; Hanafi, Latifa; Faucon, Anne-Laure; Housset, Pierre", "jour": "American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation", "affl": "Department of Nephrology, France.;;; Department of Nephrology, France.;;; Department of Microbiology, France.;;; Department of Nephrology, France.;;; Department of Nephrology, France.;;; Department of Nephrology, France.;;; Department of Nephrology, France.;;; Department of Nephrology, France.;;; Department of Nephrology, France; Centre Hospitalier Sud-Francilien, Corbeil-Essonnes; and INSERM UMRS 1018, Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Paris-Saclay University, Villejuif, France.;;; Department of Nephrology, France.

We characterized the humoral response after 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients treated with either maintenance hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 69 French patients (38 HD and 31 PD) treated at a single center who received 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. FINDINGS: Humoral response was evaluated using plasma levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 immunoglobulin measured after the second dose and at least 3 weeks after the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Patients (median age 68 years [interquartile range (IQR), 53-76 years], 65% men) had a median anti-S1 antibody level of 284 [IQR, 83-1190] AU/mL after the second dose, and 7,554 [IQR, 2,268-11,736] AU/mL after the third dose. Three patients were nonresponders (anti-S1 antibody level < 0.8 AU/mL), and 12 were weak responders (anti-S1 antibody level 0.8-50 AU/mL) after the second vaccine dose. After the third dose, 1 of the 3 initial nonresponders produced anti-spike antibody, and all the 12 initial weak responders increased their antibody levels. Patients with a greater increase in anti-S1 antibody levels after a third dose had lower antibody levels after the second dose, and a longer time interval between the second and the third dose. Adverse events did not seem to be more common or severe after a third vaccine dose. LIMITATIONS: Observational study, small sample size. Relationship between antibody levels and clinical outcomes is not well understood.

Here, we proposed to analyse the humoral immune response elicited by the primary vaccines used in Argentina from July-December 2021. METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD IgG and neutralising antibodies were assayed by ELISA in a total of 871 serum samples obtained from 376 volunteers from an educational staff. The individuals were vaccinated with BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, AZ), Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V, SpV) or combined vaccines (mostly SpV and mRNA-1273, Moderna). The antibody response was analysed several days after the initial vaccination (20, 40, 120 and 180\u202fdays). RESULTS: After receiving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, we detected 93.34% of seroprevalence. Previously SARS-CoV-2 infected showed higher antibody concentrations compared with naive vaccinees. Six months after the initial vaccination, combined vaccination induced higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels than the other vaccines in naive volunteers. However, we did not find differences in the neutralising responses after any vaccine from naive vaccines or between the naive and previously infected volunteers on day 120 after vaccination.

This third interim analysis of a living systematic review summarizes evidence on the effectiveness of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine (vaccine effectiveness, VE) and duration of protection against Omicron. METHODS: We systematically searched literature on COVID-19 for controlled studies, evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines approved in the European Union up to 14/01/2022, complemented by hand searches of websites and metasearch engines up to 11/02/2022. We considered the following comparisons: full primary immunization vs. no vaccination, booster immunization vs. no vaccination, and booster vs. full primary immunization. VE against any confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic, and severe COVID-19 (i.e., COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) was indicated, providing estimate ranges. Meta-analysis was not performed due to high study heterogeneity. The risk of bias was assessed with ROBINS-I, and the certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. RESULTS: We identified 26 studies, including 430 to 2.2 million participants, which evaluated VE estimates against infections with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. VE against any confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged between 0-62% after full primary immunization and between 34-66% after a booster dose compared to no vaccination. VE range for booster vs. full primary immunization was 34-54.6%. After full primary immunization VE against symptomatic COVID-19 ranged between 6-76%. After booster immunization VE ranged between 3-84% compared to no vaccination and between 56-69% compared to full primary immunization. VE against severe COVID-19 ranged between 3-84% after full primary immunization and between 12-100% after booster immunization compared to no vaccination, and 100% (95% CI 71.4-100) compared to full primary immunization (data from only one study). VE was characterized by a moderate to strong decline within 3-6 months for SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic COVID-19. Against severe COVID-19, protection remained robust for at least up to 6 months. Waning immunity was more profound after primary than booster immunization. The risk of bias was moderate to critical across studies and outcomes. GRADE certainty was very low for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Under the Omicron variant, the effectiveness of EU-licensed COVID-19 vaccines in preventing any SARS-CoV-2 infection is low and only short-lasting after full primary immunization, but can be improved by booster vaccination. VE against severe COVID-19 remains high and is long-lasting, especially after receiving the booster vaccination.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36091023/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fimmu.2022.940562", "pt": "Journal Article; Systematic Review", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 34763263, "aid": "S0899-7071(21)00415-0 10.1016/j.clinimag.2021.10.010", "titl": "Left Bell's palsy following the first dose of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine: A case report.", "mesh": "2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; Adult;;; *Bell Palsy/chemically induced;;; *COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Female;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; mRNA Vaccines", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Cellina, Michaela; D'Arrigo, Andrea; Floridi, Chiara; Oliva, Giancarlo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo", "jour": "Clinical imaging", "affl": "Department of Radiology, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milano, Ospedale Fatebenefratelli, Piazza Principessa Clotilde 3, 20121 Milan, Italy.

Participants were followed during March-December 2021 and tested through severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test if they developed any symptom compatible with COVID-19. Vaccination status was obtained through worker registries. VE was calculated as 100% x (1 - hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated vs unvaccinated participants), using an Andersen-Gill model adjusted for age, sex, state, and local viral circulation. RESULTS: The cohort included 43 925 persons who were mostly (96%) female with a median age of 32 years; 37 646 (86%) were vaccinated with CanSino. During March-December 2021, 2250 (5%) participants had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of whom 25 were hospitalized and 6 died. Adjusted VE was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-29%) against illness, 76% (95% CI, 42%-90%) against hospitalization, and 94% (95% CI, 66%-99%) against death. VE against illness declined from 48% (95% CI, 33%-61%) after 14-60 days following full vaccination to 20% (95% CI, 9%-31%) after 61-120 days. CONCLUSIONS: CanSino vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 illness and highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death. It will be useful to further evaluate duration of protection and assess the value of booster doses to prevent COVID-19 and severe outcomes.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35717650/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/6611492 https://sci-hub.do/ciac488 https://sci-hub.do/10.1093/cid/ciac488", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 3, "prop": 0.9678932776486152}, {"uid": 35378006, "aid": "4ffd64376912a0d0,503a524605d7b8ae 10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2021040128", "titl": "Mechanistic Episodes on SARS-CoV-2-Mediated Neurological Manifestations and Their Possible Therapeutic Interventions.", "mesh": "Animals;;; *COVID-19/complications;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; Mammals;;; *SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Nida, Sobia; Srinivisan, Hemalatha; Pandurangan, Ashok Kumar; Waseem, Mohammad", "jour": "Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer", "affl": "School of Life Science, BS Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai-600048, India.;;; School of Life Science, BS Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai-600048, India.;;; School of Life Sciences, B.S.

In November they were confronted to the fifth COVID-19 wave despite excellent vaccine coverage. We aimed to estimate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection after complete vaccination among HCWs with different vaccination schemes, and its determinants. METHODS: We enrolled all HCWs in the university hospital of Rennes, France who had received complete vaccination (two doses of COVID-19 vaccine). The delay from last vaccination dose to SARS-CoV-2 infection was computed.Fitted mixed Cox survival model with a random effect applied to exposure risk periods to account for epidemic variation was used to estimate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection after complete vaccination. RESULTS: Of the 6674 (82%) HCWs who received complete vaccination (36% BNT162b2, 29% mRNA-1273, and 34% mixed with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and were prospectively followed-up for a median of 7.0 [6.3-8.0] months, 160 (2.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Incidence density of SARS-CoV-2 infection after complete vaccination was 3.39 [2.89-3.96] infections per 1000 person-month. Median time from vaccine completion to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.5 [3.2-6.6] months. Using fitted mixed Cox regression with the delay as a time-dependent variable and random effect applied to exposure risk periods, age (P < 0.001) was independently associated with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine schemes were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (P = 0.068). A period effect was significantly associated with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world study, incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases with time in fully vaccinated HCWs with no differences according to the vaccination scheme.

Given suboptimal COVID-19 vaccine uptake among immunocompromised populations, it is important to monitor the effectiveness of fewer than the recommended doses in this population. METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California to evaluate the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of the 3-dose series vs 2 doses of mRNA-1273 in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes among immunocompromised individuals. RESULTS: We included 21,942 3-dose recipients who were 1:1 matched with randomly selected 2-dose recipients (third doses accrued 08/12/2021-12/31/2021, with follow-up through 01/31/2022). Adjusted rVE of 3 vs 2 doses of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and COVID-19 hospital death were 55.0 % (95 % CI: 50.8-58.9 %), 83.0 % (75.4-88.3 %), and 87.1 % (30.6-97.6 %), respectively. CONCLUSION: Three doses of mRNA-1273 were associated with a significantly higher rVE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes, compared to 2 doses. These findings were consistent across subgroups of demographic and clinical characteristics, and mostly consistent across subgroups of immunocompromising conditions.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Antibody analysis was performed with Alinity i System (Abbott). At 2 months, 100% of vaccinated had anti-S1 IgG (mean = 13,285 AU ml(-1) ). This value was significantly higher with Moderna (18,192 AU ml(-1) ) than with Pfizer (10,441 AU ml(-1) ). The mean value of anti-S1 IgG after vaccination was significantly higher in patients with than without previous infection (18,539 vs. 7919 AU ml(-1) ); in both groups was significantly higher with Moderna than with Pfizer (21,881 vs. 15,733 AU ml(-1) and 11,949 vs. 6387 AU ml(-1) ), respectively. At 8 months, 100% of patients were IgG positive, with higher levels with Moderna than with Pfizer. Nevertheless, in ensemble of cases, a mean decrease of antibody levels of 11,025 AU ml(-1) was observed. CONCLUSION: At 2 and 8 months after vaccination, IgG response persists with both vaccines but with important decrease which suggests the need for revaccination.

Although whole genome sequencing is the gold standard for virus characterisation, the discovery of alpha VOC causing spike gene target failure (SGTF) result, when tested using an reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay, has provided a simple tool for tracking the frequencies of variants. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate if a multiplex RT-qPCR assay (BioM 4Plex VOC) could be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and to perform a VOC screening test in a single reaction tube. Here, we present the multicentre study evaluating this assay. METHODS: Twelve laboratories have participated in the multicentre study. The BioM 4Plex VOC was distributed to them with detailed instructions of how to perform the test. They were asked to test the BioM 4Plex VOC in parallel with their routine Commercial SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay. Additionally, they were requested to select SARS-CoV-2-positive samples with genome sequenced and lineage definition according to PANGO lineage classification. FINDINGS: The BioM 4Plex VOC and commercial RT-PCR assay are equally effective in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Results revealed a specificity of 96.5-100% [95% confidence interval (CI)], a sensitivity of 99.8-100% (95% CI), and an accuracy of 99.8-100% (95% CI). A 99% concordance rate was found between results from the BioM 4Plex VOC and that from available genome sequencing data. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The BioM 4Plex VOC provides an effective solution to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections and screening for VOCs in a single reaction.

We examined humoral immunogenicity following third-dose mRNA vaccine administration in Korean SOTRs who received primary COVID-19 vaccine series on homologous or heterologous schedules. METHODS: We recruited SOTRs at Severance Hospital from October 27, 2021, to March 31, 2022. Blood samples were collected between 14 days and 5 months after the second and third mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) doses. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG titer was analyzed. The neutralization inhibition rate was analyzed using the surrogate neutralization assay for the wild-type, Delta, and Omicron variants. RESULTS: No significant differences existed in the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG positivity rate between the homologous BNT162b2/BNT162b2/BNT162b2 (85%) and other heterologous groups (83% of ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1/BNT162b2, 90% of ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1/mRNA-1273, and 78% of ChAdOx1/BNT162b2/BNT162b2). No significant difference existed in the neutralization inhibition rates between the four groups for wild-type, Delta, and Omicron variants. Median neutralization inhibition rates against the Omicron variant (2-5%) were significantly lower than those against the wild-type (87-97%) and Delta (55-89%) variants (P < 0.001).

METHODS: We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron and delta (B.1.617.2) variants in England. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated after primary immunization with two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and after a booster dose of BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or mRNA-1273. RESULTS: Between November 27, 2021, and January 12, 2022, a total of 886,774 eligible persons infected with the omicron variant, 204,154 eligible persons infected with the delta variant, and 1,572,621 eligible test-negative controls were identified. At all time points investigated and for all combinations of primary course and booster vaccines, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease was higher for the delta variant than for the omicron variant. No effect against the omicron variant was noted from 20 weeks after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 doses, whereas vaccine effectiveness after two BNT162b2 doses was 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.9 to 67.0) at 2 to 4 weeks, dropping to 8.8% (95% CI, 7.0 to 10.5) at 25 or more weeks. Among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 62.4% (95% CI, 61.8 to 63.0) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before decreasing to 39.6% (95% CI, 38.0 to 41.1) at 10 or more weeks. Among BNT162b2 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 67.2% (95% CI, 66.5 to 67.8) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before declining to 45.7% (95% CI, 44.7 to 46.7) at 10 or more weeks. Vaccine effectiveness after a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course increased to 70.1% (95% CI, 69.5 to 70.7) at 2 to 4 weeks after an mRNA-1273 booster and decreased to 60.9% (95% CI, 59.7 to 62.1) at 5 to 9 weeks. After a BNT162b2 primary course, the mRNA-1273 booster increased vaccine effectiveness to 73.9% (95% CI, 73.1 to 74.6) at 2 to 4 weeks; vaccine effectiveness fell to 64.4% (95% CI, 62.6 to 66.1) at 5 to 9 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Primary immunization with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 vaccine provided limited protection against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant. A BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 booster after either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 primary course substantially increased protection, but that protection waned over time.

In the future, the number of unvaccinated people worldwide is expected significantly decrease; thus, the issue of how to evaluate additional immunization for those who have completed the initial immunization remains to be addressed.

COVID-19 has been suggested to cause retinal vascular damage, with several studies on COVID-19 patients with retinal vascular occlusions. We reviewed and investigated studies on retinal vascular occlusions in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and in those vaccinated for COVID-19. METHODS: Studies that reported retinal vascular occlusion in COVID-19 patients or in vaccinated people were identified using the terms \"retinal occlusion,\" together with \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\", \"SARS-CoV-2,\" \"COVID-19,\" \"coronavirus,\" and \"vaccine,\" through systematic searches of PubMed and Google Scholar databases until January 7, 2022. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of retinal artery occlusion (RAO) and 14 cases of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) were identified among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Half of the patients with RAO or RVO revealed no systemic disorders except current or past COVID-19, and ocular symptoms were the initial presentation in five cases. Among patients with RAO, most presented with central RAO at 1-14 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, with abnormal coagulation and inflammatory markers. Among those with RVO, two-thirds presented with central RVO and one-third with RVO. Eleven cases with acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) and/or paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) were reported among patients with COVID-19, presenting scotoma resolved spontaneously in most cases. Among the 26 cases vaccinated with either mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccines for COVID-19 and presenting retinal vascular occlusions, there were more RVO cases than RAO cases, and ocular symptoms mostly occurred within 3 weeks after vaccination. One case presented bilateral AMN and PAMM after COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSION: Retinal vascular occlusions might be a manifestation of COVID-19, although rare, especially in patients at risk of systemic hypercoagulability and thromboembolism.

PURPOSE: We examine mask wearing behavior during the height of the pandemic in Los Angeles County, and its association with COVID-19 testing and willingness to get vaccinated. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using representative sampling between December 2020 and January 2021, through an online platform targeting Los Angeles County residents. Survey items include demographic characteristics, health conditions, access to health care, mask wearing, COVID-19 testing, exposure risk factors, and willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. We performed logistic regression models to examine factors associated with always mask wearing. RESULTS: Of the analytic sample (n = 1,984), 75.3% reported always wearing a face mask when leaving home. Being a female, Asian or African American, or non-Republican resident, or having higher education, having poor or fair health, having a regular doctor, knowing someone hospitalized for COVID-19, and being willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were associated with always wearing a mask.

Post-authorization safety data have also identified myocarditis as a rare safety event following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among adolescent and young-adult males after dose 2. We further evaluated the potential risk by querying the Moderna global safety database for myocarditis/myopericarditis reports among mRNA-1273 recipients worldwide. METHODS: Myocarditis/myopericarditis reports from 18 December 2020 to 15 February 2022 were reviewed and classified. The reported rate after any known mRNA-1273 dose was calculated according to age and sex, then compared with a population-based incidence rate to calculate observed-to-expected rate ratios (RRs). RESULTS: During the study period, 3017 myocarditis/myopericarditis cases among 252 million mRNA-1273 recipients who received at least 1 dose were reported to the Moderna global safety database. The overall reporting rate was 9.23 per 100 000 person-years, which was similar to the expected reference rate (9.0 cases per 100 000 person-years; RR [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.03 [.97-1.08]). When stratified by sex and age, observed rates were highest for males aged <40 years, particularly those 18-24 years (53.76 per 100 000 person-years), which was higher than expected (RR [95% CI], 3.10 [2.68-3.58]). When considering only cases occurring within 7 days of a known dose, the observed rate was highest for males aged 18-24 years after dose 2 (4.23 per 100 000 doses administered).

Therefore, quick and massive deployment of SARS-CoV-2 testing plays a crucial role in the identification and isolation of infected patients. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard for COVID-19 detection; however, it needs expertise, facilities, and time. Hence, for the ease of population-wide screening, serology-based diagnostic assays were introduced. These can help determine the prevalence of infection, understand the epidemiology of the disease, and assist in suitable public health interventions while being user-friendly and less time consuming. Although serological testing kits in markets soared, their sensitivity and specificity were questioned in reports from different parts of the world. In this article, we have reviewed 40 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CE-approved clinically evaluated serological kits (8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] kits, 10 chemiluminescent immunoassay [CLIA] kits, and 22 lateral flow immunoassay [LFIA] kits) for their sensitivity and specificity and discussed the apparent reasons behind their performance. We observed appreciable sensitivity in the kits detecting total antibodies compared to the kits targeting single isotype antibodies.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult SOTRs diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 from January 2022 through May 2022 who received either bebtelovimab or sotrovimab. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were analyzed with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among 361 SOTRs, 92 (25.5%) received bebtelovimab and 269 (74.5%) received sotrovimab. The most common organ transplant was a kidney (42.4%). SOTRs who received bebtelovimab had a higher proportion who had received a booster SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose and had received their last vaccination dose more recently. Eleven (3.0%) SOTRs were hospitalized, and rates of hospitalization were similar between monoclonal antibody groups (3.3% versus 3.0%; p > .99).

However, infection after vaccination still occurs. We evaluated all infections identified among recipients of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in five U.S. states during January-March 2021. METHODS: Using observational data reported to CDC, we compared the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, and the sex, age, and vaccine product received for individuals with vaccine breakthrough infections to those of the vaccinated population using Poisson regression models. We also compared the proportion of vaccine breakthrough cases due to a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern to data reported to CDC's national genomic surveillance program. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence of reported SARS-CoV-2 infection was 97% lower among vaccinated as compared to unvaccinated persons aged >/= 16 years (68 vs 2252 cases per 100,000 people). Vaccinated adults aged >/= 85 years were 1.6 times (95% CI 1.3-1.9) as likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 than vaccinated adults aged < 65 years. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine recipients were 1.4 times (95% CI 1.3-1.6) as likely to experience infection compared to Moderna COVID-19 recipients. The proportion of infections among vaccinated persons caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern was similar to the proportion of circulating viruses identified as variants of concern in the five states during the same time. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinated persons had a substantially lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to unvaccinated persons. Adults aged >/= 85 years and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients had a higher risk of infection following vaccination.

METHODS: Patients with CLD and complete basic or booster immunization with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were included in this study. Based on the vaccination situation, they were divided into the basic immunity group (Basic) and the booster immunity group (Booster), which were then subdivided into four groups according to the time interval from completion of basic immunization or booster immunization to serological specimen collection. The positive rates and antibody titers of novel coronavirus neutralizing antibody (nCoV NTAb) and novel coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain antibody (nCoV S-RBD) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 313 patients with CLD were enrolled in this study, including 201 in Basic and 112 in Booster. The positive rates of nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD within 30 days of completing basic immunization were 80.4% and 84.8%, respectively, but decreased rapidly with the extension of vaccination time, and only 29% and 48.4% of patients with CLD remained positive for nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD, respectively, after 120 days of completing basic immunization. Within 30 days of booster immunization, the positive rates of nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD in patients with CLD rapidly increased from 29.0% and 48.4% at the end of basic immunization to 95.2% and 90.5%, and maintained a high level (defined as the positive rate >50%) until 120 days when the positive rates of nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD were still high at 79.5% and 87.2%, respectively. After basic immunization, the time for nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD to turn negative was 120 and 169 days, respectively, and the negative time of nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD was significantly prolonged to 266 days and 329 days, respectively.

In addition, it has been found that the pathogenesis of this virus involves the binding of the virus's S protein to its host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which results in the subsequent membrane fusion that is required for SARS-CoV-2 to replicate and complete its entire life. The clinical symptoms of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can range from asymptomatic to severe. The most common symptoms seen include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Once these symptoms are observed, a nucleic acid test is done using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This currently serves as the main confirmatory tool for COVID-19. Despite the fact that no cure has been found for SARS-CoV-2, prevention methods such as vaccines, specific facial mask, and social distancing have proven to be quite effective.

METHODS: Capitalizing on OnCovid (NCT04393974) registry data we reported COVID-19 mortality and proxies of COVID-19 morbidity, including post-COVID-19 outcomes, according to the vaccination status of the included patients. RESULTS: 2090 eligible patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between 02/2020 and 11/2021 were included, of whom 1930 (92.3%) unvaccinated, 91 (4.4%) fully vaccinated and 69 (3.3%) partially vaccinated. With the exception of a higher prevalence of patients from the UK (p = 0.0003) and receiving systemic anticancer therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis (p = 0.0082) among fully vaccinated patients, no demographics/oncological features were associated with vaccination status. The 14-days case fatality rate (CFR) (5.5% vs 20.7%, p = 0.0004) and the 28-days CFR (13.2% vs 27.4%, p = 0.0028) demonstrated a significant improvement for fully vaccinated patients in comparison with unvaccinated patients. The receipt of prior full vaccination was also associated with reduced symptomatic COVID-19 (79.1% vs 88.5%, p = 0.0070), need of COVID-19 oriented therapy (34.9% vs 63.2%, p < 0.0001), complications from COVID-19 (28.6% vs 39.4%, p = 0.0379), hospitalizations due to COVID-19 (42.2% vs 52.5%, p = 0.0007) and oxygen therapy requirement (35.7% vs 52%, p = 0.0036).

We assessed the vaccine immunogenicity of two doses (100 mug) of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) administered with a 28-day interval in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) at follow-up at the Marques de Valdecilla University Hospital. LTRs without a history of COVID-19 infection were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed against the spike protein (S) a median of 43 days after receiving the second Moderna vaccine dose. Clinical data, including immunosuppressive regimen and routine laboratory data, were obtained from the medical record of each patient up to 3 months before the date of the first vaccination. Factors associated with serologic response were evaluated through logistic regression. In total, 129 LTRs who had anti-S results were included. Most patients were men (n = 99; 76.7%) with a median age of 63 years (interquartile range, 56-68). Alcohol (43.4%) and chronic hepatitis C (18.6%) were the most frequent causes of liver transplantation. A positive anti-S IgG response was observed in 113 LTRs (87.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 80.8-92.2). A strong inverse relationship between mycophenolate mofetil use and serologic response was found (odds ratio, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.02-0.26; p = 0.001).

METHODS: Four independent studies collected and analyzed qualitative data from study participants regarding: (1) motivators, benefits, and/or reasons for enrolling and/or participating in COVID-19 testing in schools; and/or (2) concerns, barriers, and/or negative outcomes related to COVID-19 testing in schools. Study authors conducted a retrospective review of findings from the independent studies to identify themes related to testing motivators and concerns that emerged across the studies. RESULTS: The analysis identified 10 distinct themes regarding the perceived motivators of COVID-19 testing in schools and 15 distinct themes regarding concerns and barriers to COVID-19 testing in schools. Common motivators across multiple studies included convenience of testing in school and the desire to keep self and others safe from COVID-19. Concerns about the implications of receiving a positive test result was a barrier identified by multiple studies. CONCLUSIONS: Themes from 4 independent studies revealed insights about the motivations and barriers to enrolling and participating in COVID-19 testing programs in kindergarten through 12th grade school settings.

As a virus that transmits by respiratory droplets and aerosols, determining the duration of viable virus shedding from the respiratory tract is critical for patient prognosis, and informs infection-control measures both within healthcare settings and the public domain. METHODS: We prospectively examined upper and lower airway respiratory secretions for both viral RNA and infectious virions in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Wales. Samples were taken from the oral cavity (saliva), oropharynx (subglottic aspirate), or lower respiratory tract (nondirected bronchoalveolar lavage [NBAL] or bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]) and analyzed by both quantitative PCR (qPCR) and plaque assay. RESULTS: 117 samples were obtained from 25 patients. qPCR showed extremely high rates of positivity across all sample types; however, live virus was far more common in saliva (68%) than in BAL/NBAL (32%). Average titers of live virus were higher in subglottic aspirates (4.5 x 107) than in saliva (2.2 x 106) or BAL/NBAL (8.5 x 106) and reached >108 PFU/mL in some samples. The longest duration of shedding was 98 days, while most patients (14/25) shed live virus for >/=20 days. CONCLUSIONS: ICU patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can shed high titers of virus both in the upper and lower respiratory tract and tend to be prolonged shedders.

The use echocardiography to characterize the risk of ischemic stroke in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has not been explored. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 368 patients hospitalized between 3/1/2020 and 5/31/2020 who had laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and underwent transthoracic echocardiography during hospitalization. Patients were categorized according to the presence of ischemic stroke on cerebrovascular imaging following echocardiography. Ischemic stroke was identified in 49 patients (13.3%). We characterized the risk of ischemic stroke using a novel composite risk score of clinical and echocardiographic variables: age <55, systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg, anticoagulation prior to admission, left atrial dilation and left ventricular thrombus. RESULTS: Patients with ischemic stroke had no difference in biomarkers of inflammation and hypercoagulability compared to those without ischemic stroke. Patients with ischemic stroke had significantly more left atrial dilation and left ventricular thrombus (48.3% vs 27.9%, p = 0.04; 4.2% vs 0.7%, p = 0.03).

METHODS: We used a previously published model and neutralization data for five vaccines-mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, NVX-CoV2373, V01, and CoronaVac- to evaluate long-term neutralizing antibody dynamics and predict time-varying efficacy against the Delta variant by specific vaccine, age group, and clinical severity. RESULTS: We found that homologous third-dose vaccination produces higher neutralization titers compared with titers observed following primary-series vaccination for all vaccines studied. We estimate the efficacy of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 against Delta variant infection to be 63.5% (95% CI: 51.4-67.3%) and 78.4% (95% CI: 72.2-83.5%), respectively, 14-30 days after the second dose, and that efficacy decreases to 36.0% (95% CI: 24.1-58.0%) and 38.5% (95% CI: 28.7-49.1%) 6-8 months later. Fourteen to 30 days after administration of homologous third doses, efficacy against the Delta variant would be 97.0% (95% CI: 96.4-98.5%) and 97.2% (95.7-98.1%). All five vaccines are predicted to provide good protection against severe illness from the Delta variant after both primary and homologous third dose vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Timely administration of third doses of SARS-CoV-2-prototype-based vaccines can provide protection against the Delta variant, with better performance from mRNA vaccines than from protein and inactivated vaccines. Irrespective of vaccine technology, a homologous third dose for all types of vaccines included in the study will effectively prevent symptomatic and severe COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant.

The overall sensitivity of the rapid tests ranged from 65% to 79%, and the specificity was 100% for all of them. The sensitivity was higher for those samples with RT-PCR cycle threshold (C(T)) values below 25 and those from patients presenting within the first week of symptoms. The Siemens test showed the highest sensitivity for patients with high viral loads while the Vircell test performed better than the rest for C(T) values of >/=25.

This process must be sensitive, fast, and simple, and it must be possible to carry out in any type of health center. Rapid antigen tests are the answer to this need.

The true prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is most likely underestimated, as asymptomatic children are less frequently tested. Serologic surveys indicate that half of children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 report no symptoms. Anosmia/ageusia is not frequent in children but it is the strongest predictor of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. In general, children with COVID-19 are at lower risk of hospitalization and life-threatening complications. Nevertheless, cases of severe disease or a post-infectious multisystem hyperinflammatory syndrome named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been described. Rarely children with severe COVID-19 develop neurologic complications. In addition, studies indicate that school closures have a limited impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, much less than other social distancing measures. The past months new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged with higher transmissibility and an increased impact on morbidity and deaths. The role of children in the transmission dynamics of these variants must be elucidated. Lastly, preliminary results from COVID-19 vaccine trials indicate very good efficacy and tolerability in children.

Here, we highlight recent studies on COVID-19, from the clinical and immunological characteristics to the protective and risk factors for severity and mortality of COVID-19. The efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines and potential allergic reactions after administration are also discussed. The occurrence of new variants of concerns such as Omicron BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 and the global administration of COVID-19 vaccines have changed the clinical scenario of COVID-19. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) may cause severe and heterogeneous disease but with a lower mortality rate. Perturbations in immunity of T cells, B cells, and mast cells, as well as autoantibodies and metabolic reprogramming may contribute to the long-term symptoms of COVID-19. There is conflicting evidence about whether atopic diseases, such as allergic asthma and rhinitis, are associated with a lower susceptibility and better outcomes of COVID-19. At the beginning of pandemic, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) developed guidelines that provided timely information for the management of allergic diseases and preventive measures to reduce transmission in the allergic clinics. The global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with reduced pathogenic potential dramatically decreased the morbidity, severity, and mortality of COVID-19. Nevertheless, breakthrough infection remains a challenge for disease control. Hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) to COVID-19 vaccines are low compared to other vaccines, and these were addressed in EAACI statements that provided indications for the management of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis to COVID-19 vaccines. We have gained a depth knowledge and experience in the over 2 years since the start of the pandemic, and yet a full eradication of SARS-CoV-2 is not on the horizon.

METHODS: Approximately 8.4 months after primary COVID-19 vaccination, 647 healthcare workers completed surveys about COVID-19 vaccinations/infections and blood draws. The groups included participants vaccinated with mRNA-1273 (n = 387), BNT162b2 (n = 212), or Ad26.COV2.S (n = 10) vaccines; unvaccinated participants (n = 10); and participants who received a booster dose (n = 28). The primary outcome was immunoglobin anti-spike titer. Secondary/tertiary outcomes included neutralizing antibodies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based pseudoneutralization) and vaccine effectiveness (VE). Antibody levels were compared using analysis of variance and linear regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 49.7 and 75.3% of the participants were female. Baseline variables were balanced except for immunosuppression, previous COVID-19 infection, and post-primary vaccination time. Unadjusted median (interquartile range [IQR]) anti-spike titers (AU/ml) were 1539.5 (876.7-2626.7) for mRNA-1273, 751.2 (422.0-1381.5) for BNT162b2, 451.6 (103.0-2396.7) for Ad26.COV2.S, 113.4 (3.7-194.0) for unvaccinated participants, and 31898.8 (21347.1-45820.1) for participants administered with booster dose (mRNA-1273 vs BNT162b2, P <.001; mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, or boosted vs unvaccinated, P <.006; mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, or unvaccinated vs boosted, P <.001). Unadjusted median (IQR) pseudoneutralization was as follows: 90.9% (80.1-95.0) for mRNA-1273, 77.2% (59.1-89.9) for BNT162b2, 57.9% (36.6-95.8) for Ad26.COV2.S, 40.1% (21.7-60.6) for unvaccinated, and 96.4% (96.1-96.6) for participants administered with booster dose (mRNA-1273 vs BNT162b2, P <.001; mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, or boosted vs unvaccinated, P <.028; mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, or unvaccinated vs boosted, P <.001).

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: US Veterans Affairs healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (>/=18 years) who are affiliated to Veterans Affairs with a first documented SARS-CoV-2 infection during the periods of delta (1 July-30 November 2021) or omicron (1 January-30 June 2022) variant predominance. The combined cohorts had a mean age of 59.4 (standard deviation 16.3) and 87% were male. INTERVENTIONS: Covid-19 vaccination with mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna)) and adenovirus vector vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson)). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stay in hospital, intensive care unit admission, use of ventilation, and mortality measured 30 days after a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In the delta period, 95 336 patients had infections with 47.6% having at least one vaccine dose, compared with 184 653 patients in the omicron period, with 72.6% vaccinated. After adjustment for patient demographic and clinical characteristics, in the delta period, two doses of the mRNA vaccines were associated with lower odds of hospital admission (adjusted odds ratio 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.43)), intensive care unit admission (0.33 (0.31 to 0.36)), ventilation (0.27 (0.24 to 0.30)), and death (0.21 (0.19 to 0.23)), compared with no vaccination. In the omicron period, receipt of two mRNA doses were associated with lower odds of hospital admission (0.60 (0.57 to 0.63)), intensive care unit admission (0.57 (0.53 to 0.62)), ventilation (0.59 (0.51 to 0.67)), and death (0.43 (0.39 to 0.48)). Additionally, a third mRNA dose was associated with lower odds of all outcomes compared with two doses: hospital admission (0.65 (0.63 to 0.69)), intensive care unit admission (0.65 (0.59 to 0.70)), ventilation (0.70 (0.61 to 0.80)), and death (0.51 (0.46 to 0.57)). The Ad26.COV2.S vaccination was associated with better outcomes relative to no vaccination, but higher odds of hospital stay and intensive care unit admission than with two mRNA doses. BNT162b2 was generally associated with worse outcomes than mRNA-1273 (adjusted odds ratios between 0.97 and 1.42).

We attempted to implement the hypercube pooling strategy and found it had a large quantization effect. This raised two questions: is hypercube pooling with edge = 3 actually the optimal strategy? If not, what is the best edge and dimension? We used a C++ program to calculate the expected number of PCR tests per patient for different values of prevalence, edge, and dimension. The results showed that every edge had a best performance range. Then, using C++ again, we created a program to calculate the optimal edge and dimension required for pooling samples when entering prevalence into our program.

We developed a mechanistic model to characterize the time course of humoral immune responses in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-seronegative adults after primary vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S. The persistence of antibody responses was quantified through mechanistic modeling-based simulations. Two biomarkers of humoral immune responses were examined: SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies determined by wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA) and spike protein-binding antibodies determined by indirect spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA). The persistence of antibody responses was defined as the period of time during which wtVNA and S-ELISA titers remained above the lower limit of quantification. A total of 442 wtVNA and 1,185 S-ELISA titers from 82 and 220 participants, respectively, were analyzed following administration of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5 x 10(10) viral particles). The mechanistic model adequately described the time course of observed wtVNA and S-ELISA serum titers and its associated variability up to 8 months following vaccination. Mechanistic model-based simulations show that single-dose Ad26.COV2.S elicits durable but waning antibody responses up to 24 months following immunization. Of the estimated model parameters, the production rate of memory B cells was decreased in older adults relative to younger adults, and the antibody production rate mediated by long-lived plasma cells was increased in women relative to men.

However, the effects of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, on coagulation are not well understood. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, open-label phase IV clinical trial, 270 participants including 135 adults aged 18-59 years and 135 adults aged 60 years or older, were enrolled and randomized to the CoronaVac group or to the control group in a 2:1 ratio and received two doses of CoronaVac or one dose of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and one dose of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine on days 0 and 28, respectively. Adverse events were collected for 28 days after each dose. Blood samples were taken on days 0, 4, 14, 28, 32, 42, and 56 after the first dose to evaluate neutralizing antibody titers and laboratory parameters of coagulation function and blood glucose. RESULTS: Fourteen days after the second dose of CoronaVac, the seroconversion rates of neutralizing antibodies against the prototype strain and beta, gamma, and delta variants of concern (VOC) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached peak values of 89.31%, 23.3%, 45.3%, and 53.5%, respectively. The incidence of adverse reactions was 43.6% and 52.2% in the CoronaVac group and in the control group, respectively. All were mild or moderate in severity. For the laboratory parameters, there was no difference in the means of any parameter between the two groups at any time point, except for the D-dimer on day 14. However, the D-dimer in the CoronaVac group decreased on day 14 compared to the value at baseline, while a higher D-dimer value, instead of a decreased D-dimer value, was a risk factor for TTS. CONCLUSION: CoronaVac showed a good safety profile and could induce a humoral response against the prototype and VOCs of SARS-CoV-2 in adults 18 years or older, with no abnormal effects on laboratory parameters of blood glucose and coagulation function.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37325662/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1122651", "pt": "Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 35023191, "aid": "JMV27588 10.1002/jmv.27588", "titl": "Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2: Genomics, transmissibility, and responses to current COVID-19 vaccines.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Genomics;;; Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Araf, Yusha; Akter, Fariya; Tang, Yan-Dong; Fatemi, Rabeya; Parvez, Md Sorwer Alam; Zheng, Chunfu; Hossain, Md Golzar", "jour": "Journal of medical virology", "affl": "Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.;;; Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Biotechnology Program, School of Data and Sciences, BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.;;; State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.;;; Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, East-West University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.;;; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Infectious Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.;;; Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh.", "pdat": "2022 May", "tiab": "Currently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide as an Omicron variant.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the limitations of existing virological tests, which have failed to be adopted at a rate to properly slow the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Pandemic preparedness has developed as a focus of many governments around the world in the event of a future outbreak. Despite the largely widespread availability of vaccines, the importance of testing has not diminished to monitor the evolution of the virus and the resulting stages of the pandemic. Therefore, developing diagnostic technology that serves as a line of defense has become imperative. In particular, that test should satisfy three criteria to be widely adopted: simplicity, economic feasibility, and accessibility. At the heart of it all, it must enable early diagnosis in the course of infection to reduce spread. However, diagnostic manufacturers need guidance on the optimal characteristics of a virological test to ensure pandemic preparedness and to aid in the effective treatment of viral infections. Nanomaterials are a decisive element in developing COVID-19 diagnostic kits as well as a key contributor to enhance the performance of existing tests.

A substantial risk of developing vaccine-related autoimmune toxicities could be hypothesised for patients with thymic epithelial tumours (TETs) due to their high risk of autoimmune disorders (ADs). Moreover, a cross-reaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies and various tissue proteins has been shown, and antibodies against nucleoproteins showed overlaps in the autoimmune cross-reaction with antibodies to spike protein. Due to the rarity of TETs, no data addressing this hypothesis are available. METHODS: Patients with TETs who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, treated in 4 referral centres of the Italian Collaborative Group for ThYmic MalignanciEs (TYME) network between February 2021 and September 2021, were interviewed through a standardised 15-items questionnaire in order to describe the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in patients affected by TETs. RESULTS: Data from 245 doses of vaccine administered to 126 patients (41 = thymic carcinoma, 85 = thymoma; 38 with AD, of which 26 with active AD) were collected. Nine patients had a previous COVID-19-positive swab. No cases of AD reactivation or worsening of a pre-existing AD were seen in the study population. A new diagnosis of myasthenia gravis likely unrelated to the vaccine was made in two patients after the vaccination. Sixty-four patients (51%) experienced a total of 103 adverse events, all G1/G2, most commonly fatigue, new or worsening muscle pain and chills. None AE required patients' hospitalisation.

These viruses cause significant disease that primarily seems to affect agricultural species. Human coronavirus disease due to the 2002 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the 2012 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome made headlines; however, these outbreaks were controlled, and public concern quickly faded. This complacency ended in late 2019 when alarms were raised about a mysterious virus responsible for numerous illnesses and deaths in China. As we now know, this novel disease called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and rapidly became a worldwide pandemic. Luckily, decades of research into animal coronaviruses hastened our understanding of the genetics, structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of these viruses. Coronaviruses infect a wide range of wild and domestic animals, with significant economic impact in several agricultural species. Their large genome, low dependency on host cellular proteins, and frequent recombination allow coronaviruses to successfully cross species barriers and adapt to different hosts including humans. The study of the animal diseases provides an understanding of the virus biology and pathogenesis and has assisted in the rapid development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial was conducted on 16 876 participants randomized (3:1) to receive two intramuscular doses of SpikoGen(R) or a saline placebo 21 days apart. The primary outcome was to assess the efficacy of SpikoGen(R) in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included safety assessments and evaluation of SpikoGen(R) vaccine's efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19. The study aimed for 147 COVID-19 symptomatic cases. RESULTS: Overall, 12 657 and 4219 participants were randomized to the SpikoGen(R) and placebo group and followed for a median of 55 days (interquartile range, 48-60 days) and 51 days (interquartile range, 46-58 days) after 14 days of the second dose, respectively. In the final per-protocol analysis, the number of COVID-19 cases was 247 of 9998 (2.4%) in the SpikoGen(R) group and 119 of 3069 (3.8%) in the placebo group. This equated to a vaccine efficacy of 43.99% (95% CI, 30.3-55.0%). The efficacy was calculated to be 44.22% (95% CI, 31.13-54.82%) among all participants who received both doses. From 2 weeks after the second dose, 5 of 9998 (0.05%) participants in the SpikoGen(R) group and 6 of 3069 (0.19%) participants in the placebo group developed severe COVID-19, equating to a vaccine efficacy against severe disease of 77.51% (95% CI, 26.3-93.1%).

Herein, we report 2 cases of IgAN flare after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients previously diagnosed with IgAN. We describe and compare the clinical and analytical features of the disease at the time of the diagnostic with the post-vaccine flare. In addition, we obtained serum and urine of these patients at the moment of the flare and determined the levels of IL-2, TNF-alpha, and IFNgamma using a multiplex bead-based assay. As diseased controls, we included n = 13 patients diagnosed with IgAN who had available serum and urine samples at the moment of the diagnostic stored in our biobank. We also included 6 healthy controls. Compared to the first episode, postvaccination flares were more severe in terms of peak serum creatinine, albuminuria, and urinary erythrocyte count. The histological lesions found at the biopsy performed during the post-vaccine flare were similar to those found at the diagnostic. One of the patients who suffered a post-vaccine flare showed increased serum IL-2 and TNFalpha compared to the IgAN-diseased controls and the healthy controls. In conclusion, although several cases of post-vaccine IgAN flares have been reported, there are no mechanistic studies on the occurrence of these flares.

Rapid identification and isolation of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are critical methods for blocking COVID-19 transmission. The advantages of antigen tests, such as their relatively low cost and short turnaround time, can contribute to the prompt identification of infectious individuals. However, the diagnostic accuracy of antigen tests for COVID-19 in children remains inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 in the pediatric population. METHODS: We conducted a literature search for relevant studies in the PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Biomed Central databases. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients were included. In addition, we included studies that provided sufficient data to construct a 2 x 2 table on a per-patient basis. The final literature search was performed on October 10, 2021. Days after symptom onset, asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals may have been potential sources of heterogeneity. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the antigen tests were generated using a bivariate random-effects model. RESULTS: Five studies with 4400 participants were included. The meta-analysis of antigen tests generated a pooled sensitivity of 65.9% (95% CI: 52.8%-77.0%) and pooled specificity of 99.9% (95% CI: 98.9%-100.0%). A subgroup analysis of studies reporting antigen test data for symptomatic patients showed a pooled sensitivity of 64.5% and a pooled specificity of 99.7%.

OBJECTIVES: To report statewide trends in vaccine administration and vaccine effectiveness in Minnesota. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used COVID-19 vaccine data from the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection from October 25, 2020, through October 30, 2021 that were linked with electronic health record (EHR) data from health systems collaborating as part of the Minnesota EHR Consortium (MNEHRC). Participants included individuals who were seen at a participating health system in Minnesota. EXPOSURES: Individuals were considered fully vaccinated in the second week after receipt of a second dose of a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine or a single dose of an Ad26.COV.2.S vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A completed vaccination series and vaccine breakthrough, defined as either a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or a hospital admission the same week or within the 3 weeks following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. A test-negative design and incident rate ratio were used to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness separately for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV.2.S vaccines. Rurality and social vulnerability index were assessed at the area level. RESULTS: This study included 4\u202f431\u202f190 unique individuals at participating health systems, and 3\u202f013\u202f704 (68%) of the individuals were fully vaccinated. Vaccination rates were lowest among Minnesotans who identified as Hispanic (116\u202f422 of 217\u202f019 [54%]), multiracial (30\u202f066 of 57\u202f412 [52%]), American Indian or Alaska Native (22\u202f190 of 41\u202f437 [54%]), and Black or African American (158\u202f860 of 326\u202f595 [49%]) compared with Minnesotans who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander (159\u202f999 of 210\u202f994 [76%]) or White (2\u202f402\u202f928 of 3\u202f391\u202f747 [71%]). Among individuals aged 19 to 64 years, vaccination rates were lower in rural areas (196\u202f479 of 308\u202f047 [64%]) compared with urban areas (151\u202f541 of 1\u202f951\u202f265 [77%]) and areas with high social vulnerability (544\u202f433 of 774\u202f952 [70%]) compared with areas with low social vulnerability (571\u202f613 of 724\u202f369 [79%]). In the 9 weeks ending October 30, 2021, vaccine effectiveness as assessed by a test-negative design was 33% (95% CI, 30%-37%) for Ad26.COV.2.S; 53% (95% CI, 52%-54%) for BNT162b2; and 66% (95% CI, 65%-67%) for mRNA-1273. For SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations, vaccine effectiveness in the 9 weeks ending October 30, 2021, was 78% (95% CI, 75%-81%) for Ad26.COV.2.S; 81% (95% CI, 79%-82%) for BNT162b2; and 81% (95% CI, 79%-82%) for mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of data from a Minnesota statewide consortium suggests disparities in vaccine administration and effectiveness.

METHODS: In response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in mid-May 2021, Taipei City Hospital set up 12 citywide proactive community testing (PCT) stations for early identification of infected individuals from May 17 to June 20, 2021. Individuals with RAD positivity were isolated and later confirmed by RT-PCR. The c-statistic value was estimated to indicate the level of diagnostic accuracy of RAD tests. RESULTS: Of the 33,798 individuals who were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 4.4% tested positive for RAD. There was a moderate concordance (kappa = 0.67) between the RAD tests and RT-PCR assay for identifying infectious individuals. The c-statistic value of the RAD test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.8. There was a positive linear trend between the accuracy of the RAD tests and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the study population (beta = 0.04; p = .03). As the cycle threshold value decreased, the sensitivity rate of the RAD tests increased (p < .001). After implementation of the PCT program, the prevalence of COVID-19 decreased from 8.4% to 3.3% (p < .001).

However, their comparative effectiveness against COVID-19 is unclear in the real world. We evaluated the comparative effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against COVID-19 in the UK general population. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using IQVIA Medical Research Database (IMRD), an electronic primary care database from the UK (2021). We included 1,311,075 participants, consisting of 637,549 men and 673,526 women age>/=18 years, who received vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 between January 1 and August 31, 2021. The outcomes consisted of confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation for COVID-19 and death from COVID-19 in the IMRD. We performed a cox-proportional hazard model to compare the risk of each outcome variable between the two vaccines adjusting for potential confounders with time-stratified overlap weighting of propensity score (PS). RESULTS: During a mean of 6.7 months of follow-up, 20,070 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in individuals who received BNT162b2 vaccine (PS weighted incidence rate: 3.65 per 1000 person-months), and 31,611 SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in those who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (PS weighted incidence rate: 5.25 per 1000 person-months). The time-stratified PS weighted rate difference of SARS-CoV-2 infection for BNT162b2 group vs. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group was -1.60 per 1000 person-months (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.76 to -1.43 per 1000 person-months), and the hazard ratio was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.71). The results were similar across the stratum of sex, age (<65 and >/=65 years), and study periods (i.e., alpha-variant predominance period and delta-variant predominance period). The PS weighted incidence of hospitalisation for COVID-19 was also lower in the BNT162b2 vaccine group than that in the ChAdOx1 vaccine group (RD: -0.09, 95%CI: -0.13 to -0.05 per 1000 person-months; HR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.57 to 0.74). No significant difference in the risk of death from COVID-19 was observed between the two comparison groups.

We describe the implementation of caregiver COVID-19 testing before inpatient pediatric admissions and the effect on patient cohorting and bed capacity. METHODS: We implemented an ordering pathway to facilitate COVID-19 testing of caregivers of patients admitted to the inpatient units from the pediatric emergency department, elective procedural admissions, or direct admissions at a tertiary children's hospital in the Northeastern United States in August 2021. Testing was expedited by the clinical laboratory, and caregiver results were used to inform cohorting, infection prevention, and bed management decisions. RESULTS: From August 2021 to January 2022, 2558 caregiver tests were ordered through this pathway, and 83 (3.2%) were positive. Of the positive tests, 72 (86.7%) occurred after December 18, 2021, coinciding with the local Omicron variant wave. Among positives, 67 caregiver or child pairs were identified, and 36 positive caregivers had a COVID-19 negative child leading to use of isolation precautions. Reintroduction of patient cohorting increased overall bed capacity from 74% to 100% of available beds. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of COVID-19 among caregivers before admission correlated well with rates of COVID-19 positivity among asymptomatic adults in the community during the study period. Implementation of caregiver testing increased bed capacity by reintroducing cohorting of patients and identified patients needing isolation that would have been missed by patient testing alone.

Since firstly reported by World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2021, Omicron variant has been spreading rapidly and has become the dominant variant in many countries worldwide. Omicron is the most mutated variant so far, containing 60 mutations in its genome, including 37 mutations in the S-protein. Since all current COVID-19 vaccines in use were developed based on ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strains, whether they are protective against Omicron is a critical question which has been the center of study currently. In this article, we systemically reviewed the studies regarding the effectiveness of 2- or 3-dose vaccines delivered in either homologous or heterologous manner. The humoral and cellular immune responses elicited by various vaccine regimens to protect against Omicron variant are discussed. Current understanding of the molecular basis underlying immune escape of Omicron was also analyzed. These studies indicate that two doses of vaccination are insufficient to elicit neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron variant. Nevertheless, Omicron-specific humoral immune responses can be enhanced by booster dose of almost all type vaccines in certain degree, and heterologous vaccination strategy may represent a better choice than homogenous regimens. Intriguingly, results of studies indicate that all current vaccines are still able to elicit robust T cell response against Omicron.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all persons aged >/=6 months receive an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA booster dose (3). The safety of bivalent mRNA booster doses among persons aged >/=12 years has previously been described (4). To characterize the safety of bivalent mRNA booster doses among children aged 5-11 years after receipt of bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna booster doses, CDC reviewed adverse events and health impacts reported to v-safe,* a voluntary, smartphone-based U.S. safety surveillance system established by CDC to monitor adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, and to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a U.S. passive vaccine safety surveillance system co-managed by CDC and FDA(dagger) (5). During October 12-January 1, 2023, a total of 861,251 children aged 5-11 years received a bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech booster, and 92,108 children aged 6-11 years received a bivalent Moderna booster.( section sign) Among 3,259 children aged 5-11 years registered in v-safe who received a bivalent booster dose, local (68.7%) and systemic reactions (49.5%) were commonly reported in the week after vaccination. Approximately 99.8% of reports to VAERS for children aged 5-11 years after bivalent booster vaccination were nonserious. There were no reports of myocarditis or death after bivalent booster vaccination. Eighty-four percent of VAERS reports were related to vaccination errors, 90.5% of which did not list an adverse health event. Local and systemic reactions reported after receipt of a bivalent booster dose are consistent with those reported after a monovalent booster dose; serious adverse events are rare. Vaccine providers should provide this information when counseling parents or guardians about bivalent booster vaccination.

However, it became clear that CCP is not beneficial if CCP with low anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations is used, if it is administered late in advanced disease stages, and to patients who already mounted an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 at the time of CCP transfusion. On the other hand, CCP may prevent progression to severe COVID-19 when very high-titer CCP is given early in vulnerable patients. Immune escape of new variants is a challenge for passive immunotherapy. While new variants of concern developed resistance to most clinically used monoclonal antibodies very rapidly, immune plasma from individuals immunized by both a natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination retained neutralizing activity against variants. This review briefly summarizes the evidence on CCP treatment to date and identifies further research needs. Ongoing research on passive immunotherapy is not only relevant for improving care for vulnerable patients in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but even more as a model for passive immunotherapy in case of future pandemics with a newly evolving pathogen.

METHODS: A test-negative design case-control study was conducted in 16 healthcare facilities in Japan during the Delta-dominant period (August-September 2021) and the Omicron-dominant period (January-March 2022). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was calculated for 2 doses for the Delta-dominant period and 2 or 3 doses for the Omicron-dominant period compared with unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: The analysis included 5795 individuals with 2595 (44.8%) cases. Among vaccinees, 2242 (55.8%) received BNT162b2 and 1624 (40.4%) received messenger RNA (mRNA)-1273 at manufacturer-recommended intervals. During the Delta-dominant period, VE was 88% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82-93) 14 days to 3 months after dose 2 and 87% (95% CI, 38-97) 3 to 6 months after dose 2. During the Omicron-dominant period, VE was 56% (95% CI, 37-70) 14 days to 3 months since dose 2, 52% (95% CI, 40-62) 3 to 6 months after dose 2, 49% (95% CI, 34-61) 6+ months after dose 2, and 74% (95% CI, 62-83) 14+ days after dose 3. Restricting to individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 and additional adjustment for preventive measures (ie, mask wearing/high-risk behaviors) yielded similar estimates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, where most are infection-naive, and strict prevention measures are maintained regardless of vaccination status, 2-dose mRNA vaccines provided high protection against symptomatic infection during the Delta-dominant period and moderate protection during the Omicron-dominant period.

METHODS: We identified patients with SARDs being treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or glucocorticoids in the Mass General Brigham healthcare system who received either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 as their initial vaccine series. Patients were followed until positive SARS-CoV-2 test, death, or February 22, 2022. We compared the risk of breakthrough infection between BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients using time-stratified, overlap propensity score (PS)-weighted Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: We identified 9838 patients with SARDs who received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups after overlap weighting: mean age 61 years, 75% female, 52% with rheumatoid arthritis, 74% receiving conventional synthetic DMARDs, and 43% receiving biologic DMARDs. Of 5516 BNT162b2 and 4322 mRNA-1273 recipients, 446 and 329 had a breakthrough infection, respectively. The corresponding time-stratified PS-weighted rate difference of breakthrough infection was 0.71 (95% CI -0.70 to 2.12) per 1000 person-months with a weighted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.12 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.39). When follow-up was censored prior to the Omicron wave, there was a trend toward higher breakthrough risk with BNT162b2 vs mRNA-1273 (weighted HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.98). CONCLUSION: Among patients with SARDs, the risk of breakthrough COVID-19 infection is similar after receiving either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.

The lack of direct data on the safety and tolerability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in MG have contributed to vaccine hesitancy. To address this issue, the safety and tolerability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were assessed in a large cohort of MG patients from two referral centers. METHODS: Patients with confirmed MG diagnosis, consecutively seen between October and December 2021 at two MG centers, were enrolled. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and information regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection/vaccination were extracted from medical reports and/or collected throughout telephonic or in-person interviews. RESULTS: Ninety-eight (94.2%) of 104 patients included were administered at least two vaccine doses 4 weeks before the interview or earlier, and among them, 63 of 98 (64.2%) have already received the \"booster\" dose. The most frequently used vaccines were BNT162b2-Pfizer-BioNTech and mRNA-1273-Moderna. Overall, only minor side effects were reported, most commonly local pain and fever. MG worsening after vaccination was observed in eight of 104 (7.7%) cases. The frequency of worsening among muscle-specific tyrosine kinase MG cases (3/9, 33.3%) was significantly higher compared to other serological subgroups. Spontaneous symptom regression was observed in six of eight cases. Twelve of 104 (11.5%) patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection, and none of the SARS-CoV-2-infected MG patients worsened after vaccination.

A highly mutated and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has recently emerged, driving the extremely high peak of infections in almost all continents at an unprecedented speed and scale. The Omicron variant evades the protection rendered by vaccine-induced antibodies and natural infection, as well as overpowers the antibody-based immunotherapies, raising the concerns of current effectiveness of available vaccines and monoclonal antibody-based therapies. This review outlines the most recent advancements in studying the virology and biology of the Omicron variant, highlighting its increased resistance to current antibody-based therapeutics and its immune escape against vaccines. However, the Omicron variant is highly sensitive to viral fusion inhibitors targeting the HR1 motif in the spike protein, enzyme inhibitors, involving the endosomal fusion pathway, and ACE2-based entry inhibitors. Omicron variant-associated infectivity and entry mechanisms of Omicron variant are essentially distinct from previous characterized variants. Innate sensing and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 and T cell immunity to the virus provide new perspectives of vaccine and drug development.

The benefits of vaccine boosters were similar between patients receiving mRNA-based and protein-based boosters and between those with post-booster intervals of </= 120 and > 120 days. In conclusion, for HD patients with initially mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 receiving molnupiravir, the benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters are prominent, irrespective of booster vaccine types.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36851757/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/v15020543 https://sci-hub.do/viruses-15-00543 https://sci-hub.do/10.3390/v15020543", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 3, "prop": 0.8931411893631276}, {"uid": 35390803, "aid": "000524056 iaa-0183-0888 10.1159/000524056", "titl": "Trilogy of COVID-19: Infection, Vaccination, and Immunosuppression.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; Immunosuppression Therapy;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccination;;; *Viral Vaccines", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Mohanraj, Dinesh; Whitelegg, Alison", "jour": "International archives of allergy and immunology", "affl": "Faculty of Medicine, Biology and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.;;; University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom.", "pdat": "2022", "tiab": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative respiratory pathogen responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In this review, we provide an overview of vaccine efficacy studies, which have been well characterized in healthy individuals.

Consequently, vaccine-induced responses in this group are relatively unknown. Currently, limited evidence investigating vaccine efficacy within the immunosuppressed is available. Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated pathogenesis. Furthermore, we undertake a critical analysis of observed vaccine responses from clinical studies, conducted in healthy and immunosuppressed populations.

METHODS: In this rapid living systematic evidence synthesis and meta-analysis, we searched EMBASE and the US National Institutes of Health's iSearch COVID-19 Portfolio, supplemented by manual searches of COVID-19-specific sources, until Dec 1, 2022, for studies that reported vaccine effectiveness immediately and at least 112 days after a primary vaccine series or at least 84 days after a booster dose. Single reviewers assessed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles, and extracted data, with a second reviewer verifying included studies. The primary outcomes were vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, and mortality, which were assessed using three-level meta-analytic models. This study is registered with the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools, review 473. FINDINGS: We screened 16 696 records at the title and abstract level, appraised 832 (5.0%) full texts, and initially included 73 (0.4%) studies. Of these, we excluded five (7%) studies because of critical risk of bias, leaving 68 (93%) studies that were extracted for analysis. For infections caused by any SARS-CoV-2 strain, vaccine effectiveness for the primary series reduced from 83% (95% CI 80-86) at baseline (14-42 days) to 62% (53-69) by 112-139 days. Vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 92% (88-94) for hospitalisations and 91% (85-95) for mortality, and reduced to 79% (65-87) at 224-251 days for hospitalisations and 86% (73-93) at 168-195 days for mortality. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was lower for the omicron variant for infections, hospitalisations, and mortality at baseline compared with that of other variants, but subsequent reductions occurred at a similar rate across variants. For booster doses, which covered mostly omicron studies, vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 70% (56-80) against infections and 89% (82-93) against hospitalisations, and reduced to 43% (14-62) against infections and 71% (51-83) against hospitalisations at 112 days or later. Not enough studies were available to report on booster vaccine effectiveness against mortality. INTERPRETATION: Our analyses indicate that vaccine effectiveness generally decreases over time against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, and mortality. The baseline vaccine effectiveness levels for the omicron variant were notably lower than for other variants. Therefore, other preventive measures (eg, face-mask wearing and physical distancing) might be necessary to manage the pandemic in the long term.

Indian Government has approved Covishield (ChAdOx1 nCoV19 Corona Virus Vaccine-Recombinant) for restricted use in emergency circumstances. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating the safety profile of the Covishield vaccine among healthcare workers in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: All Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) reported to the ADR monitoring centre by healthcare workers who received the Covishield vaccine during the study period of 3 months were analysed on various parameters, and the assessment was done using the WHO-UMC scale. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 1216 beneficiaries were vaccinated with 1st dose of Covishield, and out of these, 727 beneficiaries also received 2nd dose of the vaccine. Out of the 1216 beneficiaries vaccinated, 69 ADRs were reported in 24 healthcare workers. The most common ADR reported was fever (24.64%), followed by myalgia (18.84%). No death or any serious anaphylactic reaction was observed. None of the healthcare workers experienced any adverse event during the observation period of 30 minutes. Serious reactions were reported in 4 healthcare workers as per the Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI) criteria of serious AEFI. 92% of healthcare workers recovered from ADRs during the study period. 84% of ADRs were classified as probable as per the WHO-UMC scale. CONCLUSION: As per the Government of India directives, all the healthcare workers in the institute were encouraged to take both doses of the Covishield vaccine.

METHOD: Cohort study using data from the UK Biobank during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Baseline Lp(a) was compared between SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the population controls. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had Lp(a) concentrations similar to the population controls. The risk for IHD increased with higher Lp(a) concentrations in both, the population controls (n = 435,104) and SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 6937). The causality of the findings was supported by a genetic risk score for Lp(a). A SARS-CoV-2 infection modified the association with a steeper increase in risk for infected patients (interaction p-value = 0.03). Although SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had a five-times higher frequency of thromboembolic events compared to the population controls (1.53% vs. 0.31%), the risk was not influenced by Lp(a).

However, these patients were largely excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, creating a large evidence gap. OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence rate and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for COVID-19 breakthrough infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among persons with or without immune dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a partnership that developed a secure, centralized electronic medical record-based repository of COVID-19 clinical data from academic medical centers across the US. Persons who received at least 1 dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between December 10, 2020, and September 16, 2021, were included in the sample. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vaccination, COVID-19 diagnosis, immune dysfunction diagnoses (ie, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, solid organ transplant, and bone marrow transplantation), other comorbid conditions, and demographic data were accessed through the N3C Data Enclave. Breakthrough infection was defined as a COVID-19 infection that was contracted on or after the 14th day of vaccination, and the risk after full or partial vaccination was assessed for patients with or without immune dysfunction using Poisson regression with robust SEs. Poisson regression models were controlled for a study period (before or after [pre- or post-Delta variant] June 20, 2021), full vaccination status, COVID-19 infection before vaccination, demographic characteristics, geographic location, and comorbidity burden. RESULTS: A total of 664\u202f722 patients in the N3C sample were included. These patients had a median (IQR) age of 51 (34-66) years and were predominantly women (n = 378\u202f307 [56.9%]). Overall, the incidence rate for COVID-19 breakthrough infection was 5.0 per 1000 person-months among fully vaccinated persons but was higher after the Delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain (incidence rate before vs after June 20, 2021, 2.2 [95% CI, 2.2-2.2] vs 7.3 [95% CI, 7.3-7.4] per 1000 person-months). Compared with partial vaccination, full vaccination was associated with a 28% reduced risk for breakthrough infection (adjusted IRR [AIRR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68-0.76). People with a breakthrough infection after full vaccination were more likely to be older and women. People with HIV infection (AIRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49), rheumatoid arthritis (AIRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32), and solid organ transplant (AIRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.96-2.38) had a higher rate of breakthrough infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that full vaccination was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, regardless of the immune status of patients. Despite full vaccination, persons with immune dysfunction had substantially higher risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection than those without such a condition. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (eg, mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (eg, additional doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962505/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/2787643 https://sci-hub.do/ioi210075 https://sci-hub.do/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.7024", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "pl": "United States", "topic": 3, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36300733, "aid": "\u0411\u0435\u0437 AID", "titl": "SARS-CoV-2 Testing and Patient Waiting Times in the Emergency Department.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Waiting Lists;;; Emergency Service, Hospital", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Reidy, N; Coetzee, H; Roche, C; Brazil, E; O'Sullivan, L; Brady, D; Lynch, M", "jour": "Irish medical journal", "affl": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, Mater Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.;;; Department of Emergency Medicine, Mater Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.;;; Department of Emergency Medicine, Mater Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.;;; Department of Emergency Medicine, Mater Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.;;; Department of Clinical Microbiology, Mater Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.;;; Department of Clinical Microbiology, Mater Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.;;; Department of Clinical Microbiology, Mater Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.", "pdat": "2022 Aug 18", "tiab": "Aim Emergency Departments (EDs) were impacted early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with high attendance numbers. EDs relied upon SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to triage patients and facilitate admission to appropriate wards, meaning positive patients were isolated as early as possible. In October 2020, we introduced a 24-hour SARS-CoV-2 testing service. We examined the impact of this on patient experience times (PETs) in the ED, and on healthcare-associated (HA) COVID-19 infections. Methods Data on PETs before and after the introduction of 24-hour testing were available from the ED. HA COVID-19 infections were reported weekly to the Health Services Executive as a key performance indicator. Results Mean PET prior to the pandemic was 20 hours and dropped to 10 and 13 hours respectively in the first and second wave.

The aim of the article is to systematically review the literature and report the humoral response and outcomes after the fourth dose administration in people with impaired immune system. METHODS: Published studies on the humoral response, efficacy and safety of the fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were analyzed in various settings of immunocompromised patients. We conducted systematic searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library and WHO COVID-19 Research Database for series published through January 31, 2023, using the search terms \"fourth dose\" or \"second booster\" or \"4th dose\" and \"Coronavirus\" or \"COVID-19\" or \"SARS-CoV-2.\" All articles were selected according to the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 24 articles including 2,838 patients were comprised in the systematic review. All the studies involved immunocompromised patients, including solid organ transplant recipients, patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and patients with blood cancers or diseases. Almost all patients received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 as fourth dose. All the studies demonstrated the increase of antibody titers after the fourth dose, both in patients who had a serological strong response and in those who had a weak response after the third dose. No serious adverse events after the 4th dose have been reported by 13 studies. COVID-19 infection after the fourth dose ranged from 0 to 21%. CONCLUSION: The present review highlights the importance of the fourth dose of covid-19 vaccines for immunocompromised patients. Across the included studies, a fourth dose was associated with improved seroconversion and antibody titer levels. In particular, a fourth dose was associated with increasing immunogenicity in organ transplant recipients and patients with hematological cancers, with a very low rate of serious side effects.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37033069/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1108546", "pt": "Systematic Review", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.9045045988420963}, {"uid": 35499301, "aid": "2072773 10.1080/22221751.2022.2072773", "titl": "Real-world effectiveness of homologous and heterologous BNT162b2, CoronaVac, and AZD1222 booster vaccination against Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "mesh": "Antibodies, Viral;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccination", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Suah, Jing Lian; Tng, Boon Hwa; Tok, Peter Seah Keng; Husin, Masliyana; Thevananthan, Thevesh; Peariasamy, Kalaiarasu M; Sivasampu, Sheamini", "jour": "Emerging microbes & infections", "affl": "Institute for Clinical Research, National Institutes of Health, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Shah Alam, Malaysia.;;; Institute for Clinical Research, National Institutes of Health, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Shah Alam, Malaysia.;;; Institute for Clinical Research, National Institutes of Health, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Shah Alam, Malaysia.;;; Institute for Clinical Research, National Institutes of Health, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Shah Alam, Malaysia.;;; Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Putrajaya, Malaysia.;;; Institute for Clinical Research, National Institutes of Health, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Shah Alam, Malaysia.;;; Institute for Clinical Research, National Institutes of Health, Ministry of Health Malaysia, Shah Alam, Malaysia.", "pdat": "2022 Dec", "tiab": "Given emerging evidence of immune escape in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron viral variant, and its dominance, effectiveness of heterologous and homologous boosting schedules commonly used in low-to-middle income countries needs to be re-evaluated.

AIMS: To evaluate or assess whether the samples taken by the patient for COVID-19 testing during this pandemic period can be used in real-life experience. METHODS: Three different samples (nasopharyngeal taken by the healthcare worker, nasopharyngeal, and saliva taken by the patient) from 132 patients were evaluated for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the samples in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were compared with real-life experience. RESULTS: Paired analyzes were performed by comparing each sample taken by the healthcare worker with the sample taken by the patient. The sensitivity of the three samples (nasopharyngeal taken by the healthcare worker, nasopharyngeal, and saliva taken by the patient) in the diagnosis of the COVID-19 was (100%, 98.7%, and 96.1%, respectively) accepted to be accurate. CONCLUSIONS: The sample taken by the paramedic was compatible compared to the real-life experience for the samples taken by the patient in the COVID-19 pandemic period.

Here, a smartphone-assisted Sensit Smart potentiostat (PalmSens) was integrated with a paper-based electrochemical sensor to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A disposable paper-based device was fabricated, and the working electrode directly modified with a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA) as the biological recognition element to capture the target complementary DNA (cDNA). In the presence of the target cDNA, hybridization with acpcPNA probe blocks the redox conversion of a redox reporter, leading to a decrease in electrochemical response correlating to SARS-CoV-2 concentration. Under optimal conditions, a linear range from 0.1 to 200 nM and a detection limit of 1.0 pM were obtained. The PNA-based electrochemical paper-based analytical device (PNA-based ePAD) offers high specificity toward SARS-CoV-2 N gene because of the highly selective PNA-DNA binding.

Although vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are being developed at a record-breaking pace, the majority of those that are licensed or currently registered in clinical trials are formulated as an injectable product, requiring a tightly regulated cold-chain infrastructure, and primarily inducing systemic immune responses. AREAS COVERED: Here, we shed light on the status of inhaled vaccines against viral pathogens, providing background to the role of the mucosal immune system and elucidating what factors determine an inhalable vaccine's efficacy. We also discuss whether the development of an inhalable powder vaccine formulation against SARS-CoV-2 could be feasible. The review was conducted using relevant studies from PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. EXPERT OPINION: We believe that the scope of vaccine research should be broadened toward inhalable dry powder formulations since dry vaccines bear several advantages. Firstly, their dry state can tremendously increase vaccine stability and shelf-life. Secondly, they can be inhaled using disposable inhalers, omitting the need for trained health-care personnel and, therefore, facilitating mass-vaccination campaigns. Thirdly, inhalable vaccines may provide improved protection since they can induce an IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33749491/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1080/14760584.2021.1903878", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review", "pl": "England", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35163227, "aid": "ijms23031303 ijms-23-01303 10.3390/ijms23031303", "titl": "RT-qPCR Detection of SARS-CoV-2: No Need for a Dedicated Reverse Transcription Step.", "mesh": "COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing/*methods;;; Clinical Laboratory Techniques;;; DNA Primers/chemistry/genetics;;; Humans;;; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/methods;;; RNA, Viral/genetics;;; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods;;; Reverse Transcription/physiology;;; SARS-CoV-2/*genetics;;; Sensitivity and Specificity;;; Temperature", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Bustin, Stephen A; Shipley, Gregory L; Kirvell, Sara; Mueller, Reinhold; Nolan, Tania", "jour": "International journal of molecular sciences", "affl": "Medical Technology Research Centre, Faculty of Health, Education, Medicine and Social Care, Anglia Ruskin University Chelmsford, Chelmsford CM1 1SQ, UK.;;; Shipley Consulting, Vancouver, WA 98682, USA.;;; Medical Technology Research Centre, Faculty of Health, Education, Medicine and Social Care, Anglia Ruskin University Chelmsford, Chelmsford CM1 1SQ, UK.;;; RM Consulting, San Diego, CA 92131, USA.;;; Medical Technology Research Centre, Faculty of Health, Education, Medicine and Social Care, Anglia Ruskin University Chelmsford, Chelmsford CM1 1SQ, UK.", "pdat": "2022 Jan 24", "tiab": "Reverse transcription of RNA coupled to amplification of the resulting cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is one of the principal molecular technologies in use today, with applications across all areas of science and medicine. In its real-time, fluorescence-based usage (RT-qPCR), it has long been a core technology driving the accurate, rapid and sensitive laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, RT-qPCR protocols have changed little over the past 30 years, with the RT step constituting a significant percentage of the time taken to complete a typical RT-qPCR assay. When applied to research investigations, reverse transcription has been evaluated by criteria such as maximum yield, length of transcription, fidelity, and faithful representation of an RNA pool. Crucially, however, these are of less relevance in a diagnostic RT-PCR test, where speed and sensitivity are the prime RT imperatives, with specificity contributed by the PCR component. We propose a paradigm shift that omits the requirement for a separate high-temperature RT step at the beginning of an RT-qPCR assay. This is achieved by means of an innovative protocol that incorporates suitable reagents with a revised primer and amplicon design and we demonstrate a proof of principle that incorporates the RT step as part of the PCR assay setup at room temperature. Use of this modification as part of a diagnostic assay will of course require additional characterisation, validation and optimisation of the PCR step.

The immunopathology of COVID-19 appears to be clearly associated with a dysregulated immune response leading to organ failure and death. Similarly, over two billion people worldwide are infected with helminth, with those living in low-middle-income countries disproportionately affected. Helminth infections have been shown to possess immunomodulatory effects in several conditions. Helminth co-infection in COVID-19 patients is one of the potential reasons for global attention to answer why COVID-19 severity is still lower in helminth endemic countries. Recent studies have shown that helminth endemic countries showed fewer cases and deaths so far and helminth co-infection might reduce the severity of COVID-19.

However, little is known about how breakthrough infection (BTI) in COVID-19-vaccinated individuals will impact the magnitude and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response. Here, we compared neutralizing antibody responses between unvaccinated and COVID-19-double-vaccinated individuals (including both AZD1222 and BNT162b2 vaccinees) who have been infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. Rapid production of spike-reactive IgG was observed in the vaccinated group, providing evidence of effective vaccine priming. Overall, potent cross-neutralizing activity against current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern was observed in the BTI group compared to the infection group, including neutralization of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This test-negative case-control study was conducted from November 2 to December 9, 2021 (Delta variant), and from January 16 to September 30, 2022 (Omicron variant), among 160\u202f002 children tested at a large national US retail pharmacy chain, for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 62\u202f719 children were tested during the Delta period, and 97\u202f283 were tested during the Omicron period. EXPOSURE: Vaccination with BNT162b2 before SARS-CoV-2 testing vs no vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR (regardless of the presence of symptoms), and the secondary outcome was confirmed symptomatic infection. Adjusted estimated VE was calculated from multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 39\u202f117 children tested positive and 131\u202f686 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (total, 170\u202f803; 84\u202f487 [49%] were boys; mean [SD] age was 9 [2] years; 74\u202f236 [43%] were White non-Hispanic or non-Latino; and 37\u202f318 [22%] were Hispanic or Latino).

The VE of 2 doses of BNT162b2 at less than 3 months by Omicron sublineage was 40% (95% CI, 36%-43%) for BA.1, 32% (95% CI, 21%-41%) for BA.2/BA.2.12.1, and 50% (95% CI, 37%-60%) for BA.4/BA.5. After 3 months or more, VE was nonsignificant for BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5. The VE of a booster dose was 55% (95% CI, 50%-60%) against Omicron, with no evidence of waning at 3 months or more. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that, among children aged 5 to 11 years, 2 doses of BNT162b2 provided modest short-term protection against Omicron infection that was higher for those with prior infection; however, VE waned after approximately 3 months in all children. A booster dose restored protection against Omicron and was maintained for at least 3 months. These findings highlight the continued importance of booster vaccination regardless of history of prior COVID-19.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36515946/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/2799549 https://sci-hub.do/zoi221323 https://sci-hub.do/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.46915", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 3, "prop": 0.914907809522845}, {"uid": 36255326, "aid": "01355-22 spectrum.01355-22 10.1128/spectrum.01355-22", "titl": "Design and Implementation of Improved SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Assays To Mitigate the Impact of Genomic Mutations on Target Failure: the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 Experience.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Clinical Laboratory Techniques;;; Mutation;;; Genomics", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Burns, Bethany L; Moody, Domonique; Tu, Zheng Jin; Nakitandwe, Joy; Brock, Jay E; Bosler, David; Mitchell, Stephanie L; Loeffelholz, Michael J; Rhoads, Daniel D", "jour": "Microbiology spectrum", "affl": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;;; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;;; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;;; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;;; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;;; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;;; Department of Pathology, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2 Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;;; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, USA.;;; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, USA.;;; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;;; Department of Pathology, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2 Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;;; Infection Biology Program, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Dec 21", "tiab": "In 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enabled manufacturers to request emergency use authorization (EUA) to facilitate the rapid authorization of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) platforms for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Uncommon SARS-CoV-2 point mutations could cause nucleocapsid (N) gene target failure (NGTF) when using first-generation Xpert Xpress assays, so improvements were designed and implemented. In response to NGTF reports and with consideration of viral genomic information in public databases, the Xpress assays were redesigned to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on qualitative assay performance. The second-generation assays include a third gene target (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) and redundant oligonucleotide probes for the N2 target. First- and second-generation assay performances were evaluated using a challenge set of samples. A second-generation assay with updated oligonucleotide chemistry received FDA EUA in September 2021. A prototype assay with oligonucleotide chemistry similar to that of the second-generation assay with FDA EUA successfully detected all three gene targets (N2, envelope [E], and RdRp) in all challenge samples (100%; 50/50), including variants with N gene mutations (g.29197C>T or g.29200C>T), which caused NGTF in the first-generation assays. Investigation and reporting of IVD target failures, public sharing of viral genomic sequence data, and the FDA EUA pathway were essential components in facilitating a short cycle time from the identification of mutations that impact the performance of an IVD assay to the design and implementation of an improved IVD assay. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 genome has mutated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Some of these mutations have impacted the performance of nucleic acid amplification tests like PCR, which are commonly used as diagnostic tools to detect an infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) process enables the rapid reformulation and regulatory authorization of improved PCRs. In our experience, the identification of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that impact PCR performance, the subsequent development of improved PCR chemistry, and the use of the FDA EUA regulatory pathway led to improved diagnostic performance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is able to keep pace with the rapidly evolving genome of SARS-CoV-2.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36255326/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/01355-22 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.01355-22 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.01355-22", "pt": "Journal Article;

Until now, real-world data on the impact of vaccination and treatment on patients with COVID-19 after CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy are lacking. Therefore, this multicenter, retrospective study was conducted with data from the EPICOVIDEHA survey. Sixty-four patients were identified. The overall mortality caused by COVID-19 was 31%. Patients infected with the Omicron variant had a significantly lower risk of death due to COVID-19 compared with patients infected with previous variants (7% vs 58% [P = .012]). Twenty-six patients were vaccinated at the time of the COVID-19 diagnosis. Two vaccinations showed a marked but unsignificant reduction in the risk of COVID-19-caused mortality (33.3% vs 14.2% [P = .379]). In addition, the course of the disease appears milder with less frequent intensive care unit admissions (39% vs 14% [P = .054]) and a shorter duration of hospitalization (7 vs 27.5 days [P = .022]). Of the available treatment options, only monoclonal antibodies seemed to be effective at reducing mortality from 32% to 0% (P = .036).

RESULTS: A total of 53 patients, including 12 and 41 with mild and severe COVID-19, respectively, were analyzed. In addition, a total of 73 healthcare workers, including 37 who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 36 who received BNT162b2, were enrolled. Antibody responses after the first and second doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine were similar to those in convalescent patients with mild COVID-19, but lower than those in convalescent patients with severe COVID-19, respectively. However, after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, the antibody response was comparable to that in convalescent patients with severe COVID-19.

Thousands of mutations have emerged since the beginning of the pandemic throughout all virus genomes sequenced to date, resulting in thousands of distinct variants. However, some variants have recently been discovered that appear to increase transmissibility and may affect illness pervasiveness. In this study, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 variants and how countries intervene with them.

DESIGN: Test negative case-control study. SETTING: Community testing for covid-19 in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged >/=18 years who were residents of Sao Paulo state, had received two doses of CoronaVac, did not have a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination, and underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 from 17 January to 14 December 2021. Cases were matched to test negative controls by age (in 5 year bands), municipality of residence, healthcare worker status, and epidemiological week of RT-PCR test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic covid-19 and associated hospital admissions and deaths. Conditional logistic regression was adjusted for sex, number of covid-19 associated comorbidities, race, and previous acute respiratory illness. RESULTS: From 202 741 eligible people, 52 170 cases with symptomatic covid-19 and 69 115 test negative controls with covid-19 symptoms were formed into 43 257 matched sets. Adjusted odds ratios of symptomatic covid-19 increased with time since completion of the vaccination series. The increase in odds was greater in younger people and among healthcare workers, although sensitivity analyses suggested that this was in part due to bias. In addition, the adjusted odds ratios of covid-19 related hospital admission or death significantly increased with time compared with the odds 14-41 days after series completion: from 1.25 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.51) at 70-97 days up to 1.94 (1.41 to 2.67) from 182 days onwards. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increases in the risk of moderate and severe covid-19 outcomes occurred three months after primary vaccination with CoronaVac among people aged 65 and older.

There is now compelling evidence for the role of neutralizing antibodies in protective immunity. T cells may play a role in resolution of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, and there is a widely expressed view that T cell-mediated immunity also plays an important role in vaccine-mediated protection. Here we discuss the role of vaccine-induced T cells in two distinct stages of infection: firstly, in protection from acquisition of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection following exposure; secondly, if infection does occur, the potential for T cells to reduce the risk of developing severe COVID-19. We describe several lines of evidence that argue against a direct impact of vaccine-induced memory T cells in preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the contribution of T cell immunity in reducing the severity of infection, particularly in infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants, remains to be determined. A detailed understanding of the role of T cells in COVID-19 is critical for next-generation vaccine design and development.

We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of four COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection, hospitalisation, and death for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Using national COVID-19 notification, hospitalisation, and vaccination datasets from Brazil, we did a test-negative, case-control study to assess the effectiveness of four vaccines (CoronaVac [Sinovac], ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [AstraZeneca], Ad26.COV2.S [Janssen], and BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNtech]) for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We matched cases with RT-PCR positive, symptomatic COVID-19 with up to ten controls with negative RT-PCR tests who presented with symptomatic illnesses, restricting both groups to tests done at least 90 days after an initial infection. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to compare the odds of test positivity and the odds of hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19, according to vaccination status and time since first or second dose of vaccines. FINDINGS: Between Feb 24, 2020, and Nov 11, 2021, we identified 213 457 individuals who had a subsequent, symptomatic illness with RT-PCR testing done at least 90 days after their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and after the vaccination programme started. Among these, 30 910 (14.5%) had a positive RT-PCR test consistent with reinfection, and we matched 22 566 of these cases with 145 055 negative RT-PCR tests from 68 426 individuals as controls. Among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 39.4% (95% CI 36.1-42.6) for CoronaVac, 56.0% (51.4-60.2) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 44.0% (31.5-54.2) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 64.8% (54.9-72.4) for BNT162b2. For the two-dose vaccine series (CoronaVac, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and BNT162b2), effectiveness against symptomatic infection was significantly greater after the second dose than after the first dose. Effectiveness against hospitalisation or death 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 81.3% (75.3-85.8) for CoronaVac, 89.9% (83.5-93.8) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 57.7% (-2.6 to 82.5) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 89.7% (54.3-97.7) for BNT162b2. INTERPRETATION: All four vaccines conferred additional protection against symptomatic infections and severe outcomes among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The provision of a full vaccine series to individuals after recovery from COVID-19 might reduce morbidity and mortality.

METHODS: We enrolled healthcare workers who received two doses of either the BNT162b2 vaccine or the ChAdOx1 vaccine, all of whom received the BNT162b2 vaccine as the booster (the third) dose. Spike 1 (S1)-immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and interferon gamma producing T cell responses were measured at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days after the first dose, and at 0 and between 2 to 7 days after the booster dose. RESULTS: After the first-dose vaccination, the S1-IgG antibody responses were elicited within 14 days in the BNT162b2 group and within 21 days in the ChAdOx1 group. After the booster dose, the S1-IgG antibody responses were elicited within 5 days in both groups. The SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses appeared at 7 days after the first dose and at 4 days after the booster dose.

METHODS: The database of the largest healthcare provider in Israel was used to identify all adults aged 18 years or older with first-ever positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between January and February 2022, who were at high risk for severe COVID-19 and had no contraindications for Paxlovid use. Patients were included irrespective of their COVID-19 vaccination status. Cox hazard regression was used to estimate the 28-day hazard ratio (HR) for severe COVID-19 or mortality with Paxlovid examined as time-dependent variable. RESULTS: Overall, 180 351 eligible patients were included; of these, only 4737 (2.6%) were treated with Paxlovid, and 135 482 (75.1%) had adequate COVID-19 vaccination status. Both Paxlovid and adequate COVID-19 vaccination status were associated with significant decrease in the rate of severe COVID-19 or mortality with adjusted HRs of 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], .39-.75) and 0.20 (95% CI, .17-.22), respectively. Paxlovid appears to be more effective in older patients, immunosuppressed patients, and patients with underlying neurological or cardiovascular disease (interaction P < .05 for all).

Four out of four tested lots of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 contained significantly higher than expected levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) and of free viral proteins. The most abundant contaminating HCPs belonged to the heat-shock protein and cytoskeletal protein families.

Vaccines seem to be the only promising and effective way to fight against the novel coronavirus - even against new mutated variants. Because of the rapid development and distribution of numerous COVID-19 vaccines in different platforms, meticulous evaluation of vaccines' safety is more critical than ever - especially given the fact that most of the candidates have not completed the clinical phase. Therefore, to optimize the vaccines' safety and efficacy, it is highly important to carefully report and scientifically discuss the serious adverse effects following vaccination. In this respect, we discuss different neurological and neuropsychological adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines including demyelinating diseases, Bell's palsy (BP), cerebrovascular complications, seizures, functional neurological disorders (FNDs), and some other rare adverse events, and hypothetical mechanisms which can lead to the reported side effects. Given the fact that the incidence of such events are rare and most of them are treatable, the current review aims to shed light on how much the relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and these complications can be reliable and provide an insight for future studies with much more meticulous methodologies to discuss the possible correlational or causal relationship between these complications and COVID-19 vaccines and elucidate whether or not the neurological side effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines can count as a considerable threat to public health.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35334195/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/revneuro-2022-0006 https://sci-hub.do/10.1515/revneuro-2022-0006", "pt": "Journal Article; Review", "pl": "Germany", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 37187043, "aid": "S0171-2985(23)00061-X 152393 10.1016/j.imbio.2023.152393", "titl": "Complement and COVID-19: Three years on, what we know, what we don't know, and what we ought to know.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *COVID-19;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Pandemics/prevention & control;;; Complement System Proteins", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Zelek, Wioleta M; Harrison, Richard A", "jour": "Immunobiology", "affl": "Dementia Research Institute and Division of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.;;; School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.

In the following discussion, while recognising that complement is just one of many players in COVID-19, we focus on the relationship between complement and COVID-19 disease, with limited digression into directly-related areas such as the relationship between complement, kinin release, and coagulation. Prior to the 2019 COVID-19 outbreak, an important role for complement in coronavirus diseases had been established. Subsequently, multiple investigations of patients with COVID-19 confirmed that complement dysregulation is likely to be a major driver of disease pathology, in some, if not all, patients. These data fuelled evaluation of many complement-directed therapeutic agents in small patient cohorts, with claims of significant beneficial effect. As yet, these early results have not been reflected in larger clinical trials, posing questions such as who to treat, appropriate time to treat, duration of treatment, and optimal target for treatment. While significant control of the pandemic has been achieved through a global scientific and medical effort to comprehend the etiology of the disease, through extensive SARS-CoV-2 testing and quarantine measures, through vaccine development, and through improved therapy, possibly aided by attenuation of the dominant strains, it is not yet over.

Various public health measures, including vaccination, have been implemented to control the spread of the virus worldwide. India, being a densely populated country, required laboratories in different zones of the country with the capacity to test a large number of samples and report test results at the earliest. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) took the lead role in developing policies, generating advisories, formulating guidelines, and establishing and approving testing centers for COVID-19 testing. With advisories of ICMR, the National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR) established a high-throughput viral diagnostic laboratory (HTVDL) for RT-PCR-based diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in April 2020. HTVDL was established during the first lockdown to serve the nation in developing and adopting rapid testing procedures and to expand the testing capacity using \"Real-Time PCR.\" The HTVDL provided its testing support to the national capital territory of Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh, with a testing capacity of 6000 tests per day.

We found that previous infection induced CD4 T cells that vigorously responded to pools of peptides derived from the S and N proteins. By using statistical and machine learning models, we observed that the T cell response highly correlated with a compound titer of antibodies against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), S and N. However, while serum antibodies decayed over time, the cellular phenotype of these individuals remained stable over four months. Our computational analysis demonstrates that in young adults, asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections can induce robust and long-lasting CD4 T cell responses that exhibit slower decays than antibody titers.

RESULTS: Thirteen female employees who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) during the first 3 weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollout at San Francisco General Hospital reported a pruritic rash at the injection site appearing 3 -9 days after receipt of their initial dose. Five had milder or similar reactions with earlier onset after the second dose. One additional female employee reported this delayed reaction only after the second dose. None reported serious adverse events or had symptoms severe enough to seek medical attention. These cases represented 1.1% of the 1275 female employees who received their first mRNA-1273 dose and 2.0% of the 557 who were aged 31 -45 years during this initial vaccine rollout. None of 675 males who initiated mRNA-1273 or 3612 employees of any sex who initiated BNT162b (Pfizer) vaccination during this period reported delayed-onset reactions.

Data from the trials revealed an acceptable safety profile with mostly mild-moderate local and systemic adverse events. No serious adverse events or fatalities were seen, and most studies reported milder and lesser adverse events with Covaxin when compared with other vaccines, especially Oxford-Astra Zeneca's AZD1222 (Covishield).

One study reported adjusted effectiveness against symptomatic infection to be just 50% at 2 weeks after the second dose. Nonetheless, appreciable results were seen in previously infected individuals administered both doses. There was some evidence of coverage against the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants.

The atmosphere of a submarine is periodically ventilated and continuously scrubbed. However, the air is recycled for months until the ship is able to ventilate. An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred on a U.S. Navy fast-attack nuclear submarine (SSN) with a crew of 128 personnel. METHODS: Demographics, symptom data, and test results for all crew members on board during the outbreak were collected. Testing was completed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and symptom data were collected via a patient-reported online application. Symptom results were collected from August 4, 2020 to September 1, 2020. RESULTS: The crew was 100% male, with a mean age of 27.0 years. All crew members met the stringent medical standards for submarine and sea duty. Fifty-five Sailors tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (43.0% of the crew) during the outbreak. Additionally, nine Sailors (7.0% of the crew) met the criteria for infection despite testing negative, resulting in an overall attack rate of 50.0%. Among the 64 crew members with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, 1 (1.6%) was hospitalized. There were no deaths. Out of the 55 positive tests, there were 6 (10.9%) asymptomatic positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, SARS-CoV-2 was able to spread rapidly among a submarine crew. In 11 days, the infection spread to 64 total crewmembers out of 128.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 14 COVID-19 patients with HM between January and April 2022, who were subjected to our test-based de-isolation strategy, followed by analysis of the viral load trajectory. The viral loads of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were evaluated using the cycle threshold (C(t) ) of the reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The trajectories were classified according to the time-interval from COVID-19 onset to the attainment of C(t) values >30. RESULTS: The median interval between onset and attainment of a C(t) value >30 was 22 days. Five patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 without intense treatment histories achieved C(t) values >30 within 20 days.

This study traced SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Uganda by July 2021 to inform the necessity for refinement of the intervention medical products. A comprehensive in silico analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes detected in clinical samples collected from COVID-19 patients in Uganda revealed occurrence of structural protein variants with potential of escaping detection, resisting antibody therapy, or increased infectivity. The genome sequence dataset was retrieved from the GISAID database and the open reading frame encoding the spike, envelope, membrane, or nucleocapsid proteins was translated. The obtained protein sequences were aligned and inspected for existence of variants. The variant positions on each of the four alignment sets were mapped on predicted epitopes as well as the 3D structures. Additionally, sequences within each of the sets were clustered by family. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to assess relationship between the encountered spike protein sequences and Wuhan-Hu-1 wild-type, or the Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma variants of concern. Strikingly, the frequency of each of the spike protein point mutations F157L/Del, D614G and P681H/R was over 50%. The furin and the transmembrane serine protease 2 cleavage sites were unaffected by mutation. Whereas the Delta dominated the spike sequences (16.5%, 91/550), Gamma was not detected. The envelope protein was the most conserved with 96.3% (525/545) sequences being wild-type followed by membrane at 68.4% (397/580). Although the nucleocapsid protein sequences varied, the variant residue positions were less concentrated at the RNA binding domains.

They elicit an immune neutralizing response and thus offer protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, some questions regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines have been raised and based on sparse reports of severe systemic reactions after vaccination. Among these, evidences on the potential effect of vaccination on the acute rise in blood pressure have been recently accrued. Approved vaccines in Europe increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells. Once synthetized in the cells reached by the vaccine, the Spike proteins first assemble in the cytoplasm and then migrate to the cell surface to protrude with a native-like conformation. Spike proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response. Furthermore, the Spike proteins assembled in the cells which are eventually destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood as free-floating forms. Free-floating Spike proteins may interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors leading to internalization, degradation, and dysregulation of the catalytic activities of these receptors. The consequent loss of ACE2 receptor activity leads to a rapid drop in the generation of angiotensin1,7 resulting from inactivation of angiotensin II. The imbalance between angiotensin II (overactivity) and of angiotensin1,7 (deficiency) might play a role in the genesis of acute elevation in blood pressure.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985455/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1714/3715.37055", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Italy", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 36162300, "aid": "S0379-0738(22)00299-7 111469 10.1016/j.forsciint.2022.111469", "titl": "A systemic review and recommendation for an autopsy approach to death followed the COVID 19 vaccination.", "mesh": "Autopsy;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;;; Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccination", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Tan, Lii Jye; Koh, Cai Ping; Lai, Shau Kong; Poh, Woon Cheng; Othman, Mohammad Shafie; Hussin, Huzlinda", "jour": "Forensic science international", "affl": "Department of Forensic Medicine, Hospital Raja Permaisuri Bainun, Ipoh, Perak Darul Ridzuan, Malaysia.

These small changes were not accompanied by differences in thrombus weight and composition. The vaccinated animals presented a slight increase (by around 14-24%) in platelet aggregation. ChAd did not significantly affect blood coagulation, platelet counts, and their activation markers.

Although diagnostic tests including the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (CDC Diagnostic Panel) (EUA200001) were made available early in the pandemic, resource scarcity and high demand for reagents and equipment necessitated priority of symptomatic patients. There is a clearly defined need for flexible testing methodologies and strategies with rapid turnaround of results for (1) symptomatic, (2) asymptomatic with high-risk exposures and (3) asymptomatic populations without preexisting conditions for routine screening to address the needs of an on-site work force. We developed a distinct SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay based on the original CDC Diagnostic Panel (EUA200001), yet, with minimum overlap for currently employed reagents to eliminate direct competition for limited resources. As the pandemic progressed with testing loads increasing, we modified the assay to include 5-sample pooling and amplicon target multiplexing. Analytical sensitivity of the pooled and multiplexed assays was rigorously tested with contrived positive samples in realistic patient backgrounds. Assay performance was determined with clinical samples previously assessed with an FDA authorized assay. Throughout the pandemic we successfully tested symptomatic, known contact and travelers within our occupational population with a ~ 24-48-h turnaround time to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. Our singleplex assay had a detection limit of 31.25 copies per reaction. The three-color multiplexed assay maintained similar sensitivity to the singleplex assay, while tripling the throughput. The pooling assay further increased the throughput to five-fold the singleplex assay, albeit with a subtle loss of sensitivity. We subsequently developed a hybrid 'multiplex-pooled' strategy to testing to address the need for both rapid analysis of samples from personnel at high risk of COVID infection and routine screening. Herein, our SARS-CoV-2 assays specifically address the needs of occupational healthcare for both rapid analysis of personnel at high-risk of infection and routine screening that is essential for controlling COVID-19 disease transmission.

The efficacy and effectiveness (EV) of these vaccines must be assessed in order to determine the extent to which they can protect us against infection. Despite the fact that some affluent countries attempted to vaccinate the majority of their inhabitants, children and pregnant women were first excluded. EXPERT OPINION: While the severity of COVID-19 is less severe in children, the COVID-19-related complications are more severe.SARS-CoV-2 infection is also dangerous for pregnant women. The key to limiting disease spread is early discovery, isolation, and the development of safe and efficient vaccinations. As a result, the purpose of this study is to highlight the current development of various COVID-19 vaccine platforms for different groups of people at higher risk of COVID-19, with a special focus on children, pregnant and lactating women, as well as structural and pathogenicity elements of SARS CoV-2.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35313785/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1080/14760584.2022.2056025", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36864253, "aid": "10.1038/s41591-023-02228-4 10.1038/s41591-023-02228-4", "titl": "Predicting the efficacy of variant-modified COVID-19 vaccine boosters.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; Antibodies, Viral", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Khoury, David S; Docken, Steffen S; Subbarao, Kanta; Kent, Stephen J; Davenport, Miles P; Cromer, Deborah", "jour": "Nature medicine", "affl": "Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;;; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;;; WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.;;; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.;;; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.;;; Melbourne Sexual Health Centre and Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Hospital and Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.;;; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;;; Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. d.cromer@unsw.edu.au.", "pdat": "2023 Mar", "tiab": "Booster vaccination for the prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is required to overcome loss of protection due to waning immunity and the spread of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants.

The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first set of guidelines on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnosis in February 2022. Because the COVID-19 landscape is rapidly evolving, the relevant ESCMID guidelines panel releases an update of the previously published recommendations on diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2. This update aims to delineate the best diagnostic approach for SARS-CoV-2 in different populations based on current evidence. METHODS: An ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines task force was established by the ESCMID Executive Committee. A small group was established, half appointed by the chair, and the remaining selected with an open call. The panel met virtually once a week. For all decisions, a simple majority vote was used. A list of clinical questions using the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) format was developed at the beginning of the process. For each PICO, 2 panel members performed a literature search focusing on systematic reviews with a third panellist involved in case of inconsistent results. The panel reassessed the PICOs previously defined as priority in the first set of guidelines and decided to address 49 PICO questions, because 6 of them were discarded as outdated/non-clinically relevant. The 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)-adoption, adaptation, and de novo development of recommendations (ADOLOPMENT)' evidence-to-decision framework was used to produce the guidelines. QUESTIONS ADDRESSED BY THE GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS: After literature search, we updated 16 PICO questions; these PICOs address the use of antigen-based assays among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with different ages, COVID-19 severity status or risk for severe COVID-19, time since the onset of symptoms/contact with an infectious case, and finally, types of biomaterials used.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37088423/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S1198-743X(23)00192-1 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.cmi.2023.04.019", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England", "topic": 7, "prop": 0.6741280960753032}, {"uid": 35732196, "aid": "22-0650 10.3201/eid2808.220650", "titl": "Estimating COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness for Skilled Nursing Facility Healthcare Personnel, California, USA.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Delivery of Health Care;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Skilled Nursing Facilities;;; Vaccine Efficacy", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Magro, Monise; Parriott, Andrea; Mitsunaga, Tisha; Epson, Erin", "jour": "Emerging infectious diseases", "affl": "\u0431\u0435\u0437 AD", "pdat": "2022 Aug", "tiab": "We estimated real-world vaccine effectiveness among skilled nursing facility healthcare personnel who were regularly tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in California, USA, during January\u2012March 2021.

However, the vaccine vials were overfilled, which allows the administration of more than 10 doses per vial. We have stipulated the preparation and use of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine using traditional 21 or 25G needles and planned to investigate the immune responses of participants who were administered the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine using this technique. METHODS: We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike RBD IgG and neutralising antibody using a surrogate virus neutralising test (sVNT) among adults aged 18-72 years on average of 8.57 weeks (IQR 6.85-8.93) after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The primary outcome was the antibody level. The secondary outcomes included adverse events, factors affecting antibody levels, and incidence of COVID-19 infection. FINDINGS: In all, 60 participants comprised 25 males and 35 females. The mean age was 53.70 +/- 17.48 years. BMI was 23.45 +/- 3.69 kg/m(2). Tests for the neutralising antibody were positive in 60% of the participants (71.4% among males and 44% among females). The median anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac (anti-spike IgG) level among male and female samples was 111.83 BAU/mL (IQR 73.48-196.74 BAU/mL) and 159.65 BAU/mL (IQR 100.39-371.81), respectively. The positive QuantiVac value of male and female samples was 88.00% and 98.44%, respectively (p-value = 0.382) .A good correlation was observed between neutralising Ab and anti-spike RBD IgG.

The characteristics of a commercially available anti-S antibody assay (Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S) were evaluated in a cohort of vaccine recipients. Levels were correlated with pseudotype neutralizing antibodies (NAb) across SARS-CoV-2 variants. We recruited adults receiving a two-dose series of mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 and collected serum at scheduled intervals up to 8 months post-first vaccination. Anti-S and NAb levels were measured, and correlation was evaluated by (i) vaccine type and (ii) SARS-CoV-2 variant (wild-type, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and three constructs Day 146*, Day 152*, and RBM-2). Forty-six mRNA vaccine recipients were enrolled. mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients had higher peak anti-S and NAb levels compared with BNT162b2 (P < 0.001 for anti-S levels; P < 0.05 for NAb levels). When anti-S and NAb levels were compared, there was good correlation (all r values >/= 0.85) in both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients across all evaluated variants; however, these correlations were nonlinear in nature. Lower correlation was identified between anti-S and NAb for the Beta variant (r = 0.88) compared with the wild-type (WT) strain (r = 0.94). Finally, the degree of neutralizing activity at any given anti-S level was lower for each variant compared with that of the WT strain, (P < 0.001). Although the Roche anti-S assay correlates well with NAb levels, this association is affected by vaccine type and SARS-CoV-2 variant. These variables must be considered when interpreting anti-S levels. IMPORTANCE We evaluated anti-spike antibody concentrations in healthy mRNA vaccinated individuals and compared these concentrations to values obtained from pseudotype neutralization assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern to determine how well anti-spike antibodies correlate with neutralizing titers, which have been used as a marker of immunity from COVID-19 infection. We found high peak anti-spike concentrations in these individuals, with significantly higher levels seen in mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. When we compared anti-spike and pseudotype neuralization titers, we identified good correlation; however, this correlation was affected by both vaccine type and variant, illustrating the difficulty of applying a \"one size fits all\" approach to anti-spike result interpretation. Our results support CDC recommendations to discourage anti-spike antibody testing to assess for immunity after vaccination and cautions providers in their interpretations of these results as a surrogate of protection in COVID-vaccinated individuals.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35311584/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/00211-22 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.00211-22 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.00211-22", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "pl": "United States", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.9947145979267231}, {"uid": 36054016, "aid": "6687716 jiac360 10.1093/infdis/jiac360", "titl": "Effectiveness of CoronaVac and BNT162b2 Vaccines Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Omicron BA.2 Infections in Hong Kong.", "mesh": "Adult;;; *BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Hong Kong/epidemiology;;; Humans;;; RNA, Messenger;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccines, Inactivated", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Yang, Bingyi; Wong, Irene O L; Xiao, Jingyi; Tsang, Tim K; Liao, Qiuyan; Cowling, Benjamin J", "jour": "The Journal of infectious diseases", "affl": "WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health Limited, Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, New Territories, Hong Kong, China.;;; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health Limited, Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, New Territories, Hong Kong, China.", "pdat": "2022 Oct 17", "tiab": "There is limited evidence on vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic or mild Omicron infections.

Few data exist on comparative immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccines given as booster doses. We aimed to assess neutralizing antibody levels raised by injectable and inhaled aerosolized recombinant adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine as a heterologous booster after an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine two-dose primary series. METHODS: Using an open-label prospective cohort design, we recruited 136 individuals who had received inactivated vaccine primary series followed by either injectable or inhaled Ad5-vectored vaccine and measured neutralizing antibody titers against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus and Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 variants. We also measured neutralizing antibody levels in convalescent sera from 39 patients who recovered from Omicron BA.2 infection. RESULTS: Six months after primary series vaccination, neutralizing immunity against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 was low and neutralizing immunity against Omicron (B.1.1.529) was lower. Boosting with Ad5-vectored vaccines induced a high immune response against ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing responses against Omicron BA.5 were >/= 80% lower than against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in sera from prime-boost subjects and in convalescent sera from survivors of Omicron BA.2 infection. Inhaled aerosolized Ad5-vectored vaccine was associated with greater neutralizing titers than injectable Ad5-vectored vaccine against ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The COVID-19 infections were continued to roll all over the places although the information on genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 between both immunized and unimmunized group was unavailable. The objective of this study was to compare the proportion of immune escaping variants between those groups. METHODS: A total of 4718 nasopharygeal samples were collected from March 1 until April 15, 2021, of which, 834 (18%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The minimum sample size was calculated as 108 who were randomly selected for telephone interview and provided consent. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and disease severity among both immunized and unimmunized groups was measured. A total of 63 spike protein sequences and 14 whole-genome sequences were performed from both groups and phylogenetic reconstruction and mutation analysis were compared. RESULTS: A total of 40 respondents (37%, N = 108) received single-dose and 2 (2%) received both doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, which significantly reduce dry cough, loss of appetite and difficulties in breathing compared to none. There was no significant difference in hospitalization, duration of hospitalization or reduction of other symptoms like running nose, muscle pain, shortness of breathing or generalized weakness between immunized and unimmunized groups. Spike protein sequence assumed 21 (87.5%) B.1.351, one B.1.526 and two 20B variants in immunized group compared to 27 (69%) B.1.351, 5 (13%) B.1.1.7, 4 (10%) 20B, 2 B.1.526 and one B.1.427 variant in unimmunized group. Whole genome sequence analysis of 14 cases identified seven B.1.351 Beta V2, three B.1.1.7 Alpha V1, one B.1.526 Eta and the rest three 20B variants. CONCLUSION: Our study observed that ChAdOx1 could not prevent the new infection or severe COVID-19 disease outcome with single dose while the infections were mostly caused by B.1.351 variants in Bangladesh.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34952247/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S1876-0341(21)00403-2 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.12.002", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England", "topic": 3, "prop": 0.8651616577344471}, {"uid": 35441938, "aid": "10.1007/s11033-022-07455-5 7455 10.1007/s11033-022-07455-5", "titl": "Considerations for the selection of tests for SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Humans;;; Pandemics;;; Pathology, Molecular;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; Sensitivity and Specificity", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Erbak Yilmaz, Huriye; Iscan, Evin; Oz, Ozden; Batur, Tugce; Erdogan, Aybike; Kilic, Seval; Mutlu, Zeynep; Yilmaz, Murat; Spring, Kevin J", "jour": "Molecular biology reports", "affl": "Department of Biochemistry, Izmir Katip Celebi University Ataturk Education and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey. huriyeerbak@hotmail.com.;;; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey. huriyeerbak@hotmail.com.;;; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.;;; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.;;; Department of Pathology, Izmir Bozyaka Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Izmir, Turkey.;;; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.;;; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.;;; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.;;; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.;;; Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.;;; Medical Oncology Group, Ingham Institute for Applied Medical Research, Liverpool Clinical School, School of Medicine, Western Sydney University, and South West Sydney Clinical Campus, UNSW Medicine & Health, Liverpool Hospital NSW, Liverpool, Australia.", "pdat": "2022 Oct", "tiab": "During the course of 2020, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly across the world.

Commercial vendors and laboratories quickly mobilised to develop diagnostic tests to detect the novel coronavirus, which was fundamentally important in the pandemic response. These SARS-Cov-2 assays were developed in line with the Food Drug Administration-Emergency Use Authorization guidance. Although new tests are continuously being developed, information about SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic molecular test accuracy has been limited and at times controversial. Therefore, the analytical and clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 test kits should be carefully considered by the appropriate regulatory authorities and evaluated by independent laboratory validation. This would provide improved end-user confidence in selecting the most reliable and accurate diagnostic test. Moreover, it is unclear whether some of these rapidly developed tests have been subjected to rigorous quality control and assurance required under good manufacturing practice. Variable target gene regions selected for currently available tests, potential mutation in target gene regions, non-standardized pre-analytic phase, a lack of manufacturer independent validation data all create difficulties in selecting tests appropriate for different countries and laboratories.

This review investigates whether  SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are as effective in triggering an immune response in Dialysis Patients (DPs) and Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTRs) and if a third dose is required in this  population. Methods: A systematic search employing the PRISMA criteria was conducted in several major databases, with the data being extracted from publications for the period January 2021 to May 2022 (PROSPERO: CRD42022338514, June 15, 2022).

Isolation of individuals with active infections offers an effective solution for mitigating pandemics. However, the implementation of this practice requires robust infrastructure for rapid and intuitive testing, which is currently missing in our communities. To address this need, we engineered a fast-growing cell line into a cell-based antigen test platform for emerging viruses, i.e., DxCell, that can be rapidly deployed in decentralized health care facilities for continuous testing. The technology was characterized using cells engineered to present spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-Sgp-cells) and Calu-3 host cells infected with competent SARS-CoV-2. Preclinical validation was conducted by directly incubating the DxCell with oropharyngeal swabs from mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. No sample preparation steps are necessary. The DxCell quantitatively detected the SARS-CoV-2-Sgp-cells within 1 h (P < 0.02). Reporter signal was proportional to the number of SARS-CoV-2-Sgp-cells, which represents the infection burden. The SARS-CoV-2 DxCell antigen test was benchmarked against quantitative PCR (qPCR) test and accurately differentiated between infected (n = 8) and control samples (n = 3) (P < 0.05). To demonstrate the broad applicability of the platform, we successfully redirected its specificity and tested its sensing function with cells engineered to present antigens from other viruses. In conclusion, we have developed an antigen test platform that capitalizes on the two innate functions of the cell, self-replication and activation-induced cell signaling. These provide the DxCell key advantages over existing technologies, e.g., label-free testing without sample processing, and will facilitate its implementation in decentralized health care facilities. IMPORTANCE Pandemic mitigation requires continuous testing of symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals with rapid turnaround time, and lack of this capability in our community has prolonged pandemic duration leading to obliteration of world economies. The DxCell platform is a cell-based self-replicative antigen test that detects molecular signatures of the target pathogen and can be distributed in small quantities to testing facilities for expansion on site to the desired volume. In this work, we directed this platform to target SARS-CoV-2. Unlike the PCR detection of viral mRNA that requires trained personnel, the DxCell does not require any sample preparation or signal amplification step and introduces an opportunity for a decentralized testing network.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35852348/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/00731-22 https://sci-hub.do/spectrum.00731-22 https://sci-hub.do/10.1128/spectrum.00731-22", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "pl": "United States", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 35513437, "aid": "10.1038/s41467-022-30162-5 30162 10.1038/s41467-022-30162-5", "titl": "Comparative analysis of COVID-19 vaccine responses and third booster dose-induced neutralizing antibodies against Delta and Omicron variants.", "mesh": "2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; Antibodies, Neutralizing;;; Antibodies, Viral;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Humans;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccines, Synthetic;;; mRNA Vaccines", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Belik, Milja; Jalkanen, Pinja; Lundberg, Rickard; Reinholm, Arttu; Laine, Larissa; Vaisanen, Elina; Skon, Marika; Tahtinen, Paula A; Ivaska, Lauri; Pakkanen, Sari H; Hakkinen, Hanni K; Ortamo, Eeva; Pasternack, Arja; Ritvos, Mikael A; Naves, Rauno A; Miettinen, Simo; Sironen, Tarja; Vapalahti, Olli; Ritvos, Olli; Osterlund, Pamela; Kantele, Anu; Lempainen, Johanna; Kakkola, Laura; Kolehmainen, Pekka; Julkunen, Ilkka", "jour": "Nature communications", "affl": "Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. milja.j.belik@utu.fi.;;; Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Department of Infectious Diseases, Meilahti Vaccination Research Center, MeVac, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Infectious Diseases, Meilahti Vaccination Research Center, MeVac, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Infectious Diseases, Meilahti Vaccination Research Center, MeVac, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Physiology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Physiology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Physiology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Virology, University of Helsinki and HUSLAB, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Virology, University of Helsinki and HUSLAB, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Veterinary Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Virology, University of Helsinki and HUSLAB, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Veterinary Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Physiology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Department of Infectious Diseases, Meilahti Vaccination Research Center, MeVac, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Clinical Microbiology, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.;;; Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.;;; Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. ilkka.julkunen@utu.fi.;;; Clinical Microbiology, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. ilkka.julkunen@utu.fi.", "pdat": "2022 May 5", "tiab": "Two COVID-19 mRNA (of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273) and two adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1 and Janssen) are licensed in Europe, but optimization of regime and dosing is still ongoing.

Thus, the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the vaccines in LTX recipients compared to controls. METHODS: An open-label, nonrandomized prospective study was conducted at Tohoku University Hospital. LTX recipients and controls who received either the BNT162b2 vaccine or the mRNA-1273 vaccine were recruited, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG was measured before and after vaccination. The adverse events were reviewed. Predictors of negative serology after vaccination were evaluated with logistic regression. RESULTS: Forty-one LTX recipients and 24 controls were analyzed. Although all controls had a positive antibody response to a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, antibody response was found in 24.4% of LTX recipients (p < .0001). The amount of SARS-CoV-2 IgG following the 2nd dose significantly climbed to 6557 AU/mL in controls, whereas the increase in IgG in LTX recipients was 8.3 AU/mL (p < .0001). Fewer LTX recipients developed systemic fever than controls (p < .0001) despite equivalent overall adverse event percentages in both groups. A higher plasma concentration of mycophenolate was a significant predictor of negative serology (p = .032). CONCLUSIONS: An impaired antibody response to mRNA vaccines was significantly found in LTX recipients compared to controls and was associated with the plasma concentration of mycophenolate.

Included were women aged 18-50 years without known gynecologic comorbidities who regularly monitor their menstruation through electronic calendars. All participants competed a detailed questionnaire on their menstrual symptoms including information on any irregular bleeding.

RESULTS: A total of 219 women met the inclusion critieria. Of them, 51 (23.3%) experienced irregular bleeding following the vaccine. Almost 40% (n = 83) of study participants reported any menstrual change following vaccination.

Patients requiring dialysis are at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality, and many have experienced psychological distress as well as delayed or suboptimal care. COVID-19 survivors have prolonged viral shedding, but generally develop a robust and long-lasting humoral immune response that correlates with initial disease severity. However, protection against reinfection is incomplete. A growing body of evidence reveals delayed and blunted immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Administration of a third dose within 1 to 2 months of prime-boost vaccination significantly increases antibody levels, in particular in patients with poor initial responses. Patients on dialysis have inferior immune responses to adenoviral vector vaccines than to mRNA vaccines. The immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273 vaccine is markedly better than that of the BNT162b2 vaccine, most likely by virtue of its higher mRNA content. Despite suboptimal immune responses in patients on dialysis, preliminary data suggest that vaccination partially protects against infection and severe disease requiring hospitalization. However, progressive waning of immunity and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with a high potential of immune escape call for a booster dose in all patients on dialysis 4 to 6 months after prime-boost vaccination. Patients with persistent poor vaccine responses may be candidates for primary prophylaxis strategies. In the absence of specific data in patients on dialysis, therapeutic strategies in the event of established COVID-19 must be extrapolated from evidence obtained in the population not on dialysis.

Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions to substantially reduce severe disease and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination programmes are being rolled out globally, but most of these vaccines have been approved without extensive studies on their side-effects and efficacy. Recently, new-onset autoimmune phenomena after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported increasingly (e.g. immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, autoimmune liver diseases, Guillain-Barre syndrome, IgA nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus). Molecular mimicry, the production of particular autoantibodies and the role of certain vaccine adjuvants seem to be substantial contributors to autoimmune phenomena. However, whether the association between COVID-19 vaccine and autoimmune manifestations is coincidental or causal remains to be elucidated. Here, we summarize the emerging evidence about autoimmune manifestations occurring in response to certain COVID-19 vaccines. Although information pertaining to the risk of autoimmune disease as a consequence of vaccination is controversial, we merely propose our current understanding of autoimmune manifestations associated with COVID-19 vaccine.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is purported to directly promote platelet activation via the S1 subunit and is cleaved from host cells during infection. High plasma concentrations of S1 subunit are associated with disease progression and respiratory failure during severe COVID-19. There is limited evidence on whether COVID-19 vaccine-induced spike protein is similarly cleaved and on the immediate effects of vaccination on host immune responses or hematology parameters. We investigated vaccine-induced S1 subunit cleavage and effects on hematology parameters using AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), a simian, replication-deficient adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine. We observed S1 subunit cleavage in vitro following AZD1222 transduction of HEK293x cells. S1 subunit cleavage also occurred in vivo and was detectable in sera 12 hours post intramuscular immunization (1x10(10) viral particles) in CD-1 mice. Soluble S1 protein levels decreased within 3 days and were no longer detectable 7-14 days post immunization. Intravenous immunization (1x10(9) viral particles) produced higher soluble S1 protein levels with similar expression kinetics. Spike protein was undetectable by immunohistochemistry 14 days post intramuscular immunization. Intramuscular immunization resulted in transiently lower platelet (12 hours) and white blood cell (12-24 hours) counts relative to vehicle. Similarly, intravenous immunization resulted in lower platelet (24-72 hours) and white blood cell (12-24 hours) counts, and increased neutrophil (2 hours) counts.

Parenteral booster injection of a vaccine against a mucosal pathogen promotes stronger mucosal immune responses following prior mucosal infection compared with injections of a parenteral vaccine in a mucosally naive subject. We investigated whether this was also the case for the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) messenger RNA vaccine. METHODS: Twenty recovered COVID-19 subjects (RCSs) and 23 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-naive subjects were vaccinated with, respectively, 1 and 2 doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) and plasma were collected before and after vaccination and assessed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody levels to Spike and for their ability to neutralize binding of Spike to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor. Blood was analyzed 1 week after vaccination for the number of Spike-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) with a mucosal tropism. RESULTS: All RCSs had both nasal and blood SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies at least 90 days after initial diagnosis. In RCSs, a single dose of vaccine amplified preexisting Spike-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses in both NELF and blood against both vaccine homologous and variant strains, including Delta. These responses were associated with Spike-specific IgG and IgA ASCs with a mucosal tropism in blood. Nasal IgA and IgG antibody responses were lower in magnitude in SARS-CoV-2-naive subjects after 2 vaccine doses compared with RCSs after 1 dose.

MAIN BODY: However, global mass vaccination has not been achieved owing to several limitations, including the need for expertise to administer the injection-based vaccine, improper distribution of the vaccine, and lack of cold chain facilities, particularly in resource-poor, low-income countries. Mucosal vaccines are typically administered either orally or nasally, and several studies have shown promising results for developing these vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that might serve as viable alternatives to current vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 invades the human body via oral and nasal mucosal surfaces; thus, an oral or nasal vaccine can trigger the immune system to inhibit the virus at the mucosal level, preventing further transmission via a strong mucosal and systematic immune response. Although several approaches toward developing a mucosal vaccine are currently being tested, additional attention is required.

This residual information is believed to be highly related to a pattern in the number of cycles that are necessary to detect positive samples as such. Thus, a database of more than 20,000 positive samples was collected, and two supervised classification algorithms (a support vector machine and a neural network) were trained to temporally locate each sample based solely and exclusively on the number of cycles determined in the rRT-PCR of each individual. Overall, this study suggests that there is valuable residual information in the rRT-PCR positive samples that can be used to identify patterns in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

however, vaccination continues to protect against progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The impact of vaccination status on symptoms over time is less clear. METHODS: Within a randomized trial on early outpatient COVID-19 therapy testing metformin, ivermectin, and/or fluvoxamine, participants recorded symptoms daily for 14 days. Participants were given a paper symptom diary allowing them to circle the severity of 14 symptoms as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). This is a secondary analysis of clinical trial data on symptom severity over time using generalized estimating equations comparing those unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated with primary vaccine series only, or vaccine-boosted. RESULTS: The parent clinical trial prospectively enrolled 1323 participants, of whom 1062 (80%) prospectively recorded some daily symptom data. Of these, 480 (45%) were unvaccinated, 530 (50%) were vaccinated with primary series only, and 52 (5%) vaccine-boosted. Overall symptom severity was least for the vaccine-boosted group and most severe for unvaccinated at baseline and over the 14 days (P < .001). Individual symptoms were least severe in the vaccine-boosted group including cough, chills, fever, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea, as well as smell and taste abnormalities.

Currently, the gold standard for virus identification is the nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. Saliva samples, however, offer clear, practical, and logistical advantages but due to a lack of collection, transport, and storage solutions, high-throughput saliva-based laboratory tests are difficult to scale up as a screening or diagnostic tool. With this study, we aimed to validate an intralaboratory molecular detection method for SARS-CoV-2 on saliva samples collected in a new storage saline solution, comparing the results to NP swabs to determine the difference in sensitivity between the two tests. METHODS: In this study, 156 patients (cases) and 1005 asymptomatic subjects (controls) were enrolled and tested simultaneously for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome by RT-PCR on both NP swab and saliva samples. Saliva samples were collected in a preservative and inhibiting saline solution (Biofarma Srl). Internal method validation was performed to standardize the entire workflow for saliva samples. RESULTS: The identification of SARS-CoV-2 conducted on saliva samples showed a clinical sensitivity of 95.1% and specificity of 97.8% compared to NP swabs. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 81% while the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.5%. Test concordance was 97.6% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.86; 95% CI 0.81-0.91). The LoD of the test was 5 viral copies for both samples. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR assays conducted on a stored saliva sample achieved similar performance to those on NP swabs, and this may provide a very effective tool for population screening and diagnosis. Collection of saliva in a stabilizing solution makes the test more convenient and widely available; furthermore, the denaturing properties of the solution reduce the infective risks belonging to sample manipulation.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35035611/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1155/2022/6478434", "pt": "Journal Article;

A deeper understanding of the susceptibility of omicron variant to vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies is urgently needed for risk assessment. METHODS: Omicron variant strains HKU691 and HKU344-R346K were isolated from patients using TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells. Whole genome sequence was determined using nanopore sequencing. Neutralization susceptibility of ancestral lineage A virus and the omicron, delta and beta variants to sera from 25 BNT162b2 and 25 CoronaVac vaccine recipients was determined using a live virus microneutralization assay. RESULTS: The omicron variant strain HKU344-R346K has an additional spike R346K mutation, which is present in 8.5% of strains deposited in the GISAID database. Only 20% and 24% of BNT162b2 recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody against the omicron variant HKU691 and HKU344-R346K, respectively, whereas none of the CoronaVac recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody titer against either omicron isolate. For BNT162b2 recipients, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titers (GMTs) of the omicron variant isolates (5.43 and 6.42) were 35.7-39.9-fold lower than that of the ancestral virus (229.4), and the GMTs of both omicron variant isolates were significantly lower than those of the beta and delta variants. There was no significant difference in the GMTs between HKU691 and HKU344-R346K. CONCLUSIONS: Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by BNT162b2 or CoronaVac. The additional R346K mutation did not affect the neutralization susceptibility.

MEASUREMENTS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from days 1 and 29 (vaccination days) and from symptom-prompted illness visits were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum samples from days 1, 29, and 57 and the participant decision visit (PDV, when participants were informed of treatment assignment; median day 149) were tested for anti-N Abs by the Elecsys immunoassay. RESULTS: Among 812 participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 illness during the blinded phase of the trial (through March 2021), seroconversion to anti-N Abs (median of 53 days after diagnosis) occurred in 21 of 52 mRNA-1273 vaccinees (40% [95% CI, 27% to 54%]) versus 605 of 648 placebo recipients (93% [CI, 92% to 95%]). Each 1-log increase in SARS-CoV-2 viral copies at diagnosis was associated with 90% higher odds of anti-N Ab seroconversion (odds ratio, 1.90 [CI, 1.59 to 2.28]). LIMITATION: The scope was restricted to mRNA-1273 vaccinees and the Elecsys assay, the sample size was small, data on Delta and Omicron infections were lacking, and the analysis did not address a prespecified objective of the trial. CONCLUSION: Vaccination status should be considered when interpreting seroprevalence and seropositivity data based solely on anti-N Ab testing.

In this article, we first review current knowledge on the immunobiology of SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccination in animal models and in healthy humans. Next, we summarize data from early trials of SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccination in patients with secondary or primary immunodeficiency. These early clinical trials identified common predictors of lower response to the vaccine such as anti-CD19, anti-CD20 or anti-CD38 therapies, low (naive) CD4(+) T-cell counts, genetic or therapeutic Bruton tyrosine kinase deficiency, treatment with antimetabolites, CTLA4 agonists or JAK inhibitors, and vaccination with BNT162b2 versus mRNA1273 vaccine.

Therefore, it is important to know how the different vaccines perform against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a prospective cohort of 165 SARS-CoV-2 naive health care workers in the Netherlands, vaccinated with either one of four vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, AZD1222 or Ad26.COV2.S), we performed a head-to-head comparison of the ability of sera to recognize and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs; Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron). Repeated serum sampling was performed 5 times during a year (from January 2021 till January 2022), including before and after booster vaccination with BNT162b2. Four weeks after completing the initial vaccination series, SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralizing antibody titers were highest in recipients of mRNA-1273, followed by recipients of BNT162b2 (geometric mean titers (GMT) of 358 [95% CI 231-556] and 214 [95% CI 153-299], respectively; p<0.05), and substantially lower in those vaccinated with the adenovirus vector-based vaccines AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S (GMT of 18 [95% CI 11-30] and 14 [95% CI 8-25] IU/ml, respectively; p<0.001). VOCs neutralization was reduced in all vaccine groups, with the greatest reduction in neutralization GMT observed against the Omicron variant (fold change 0.03 [95% CI 0.02-0.04], p<0.001). The booster BNT162b2 vaccination increased neutralizing antibody titers for all groups with substantial improvement against the VOCs including the Omicron variant. We used linear regression and linear mixed model analysis. All results were adjusted for possible confounding of age and sex. Study limitations include the lack of cellular immunity data. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study shows that the mRNA vaccines appear superior to adenovirus vector-based vaccines in inducing neutralizing antibodies against VOCs four weeks after initial vaccination and after booster vaccination, which implies the use of mRNA vaccines for both initial and booster vaccination.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35580156/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/PMEDICINE-D-21-04472 https://sci-hub.do/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003991", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 2, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35658567, "aid": "10.1177_00469580221105354 10.1177/00469580221105354", "titl": "Evaluation of a Rapid Antigen Test for the Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "mesh": "*COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Humans;;; Pandemics;;; Retrospective Studies;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; Sensitivity and Specificity", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Cheng, Chih-Chien; Liu, Chia-Chen; Chiu, Ting-Fang; Shiou-Sheng Chen, Saint", "jour": "Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing", "affl": "Department of Education and Research, 38010Taipei City Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, 34903Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; Department of Obstetrics/Gynecology, 38010Taipei City Hospital, Zhongxiao Branch, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; University of Taipei, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, 34903Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; Department of Education and Research, 38010Taipei City Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; Department of Health and Welfare, University of Taipei, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; Department of Pediatrics, 38010Taipei City Hospital, Zhongxiao Branch, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; Division of Urology, 38010Taipei City Hospital, Zhong Xiao Branch, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; Department of Urology, College of Medicine and Shu-Tien Urological Research Center, National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan.;;; Commission for General Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; University of Taipei, General Education Center, Taipei, Taiwan.", "pdat": "2022 Jan-Dec", "tiab": "OBJECTIVES: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the reference laboratory method of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, though requiring equipment, is time-consuming. There is a crucial demand for rapid techniques such as antigen detection test during the pandemic. This study assessed whether a rapid antigen detection (RAD) test was an effective and essential method for the early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The probability of public screening at home and the application of RAD during the novel SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were also topics of interest. METHODS: A retrospective analysis based on the systemic screening for COVID-19 was conducted at Taipei City Hospital (TCH) from May 28 to June 06, 2021, the first week of outbreak in Taiwan. The results of the RAD and RT-PCR tests were collected from 5 major branches of the TCH. RESULTS: We collected a total number of 6368 cases. We found that the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy ranged from 60.5% to 78.6% (mean 66.0%), 98.2% to 99.9% (mean 99.0%), 74.4% to 97.8% (mean 82.8%), 94.0% to 98.4% (mean 97.5%), and 93.8% to 98.3% (mean 94.2%), respectively. Although the sensitivity score was not high (up to 95% or higher), the other results were satisfactory, with an accuracy of more than 93% in all branches. Furthermore, it had high specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy. CONCLUSION: We concluded that RAD could be a quick and feasible method to identify individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 from non-contagious individuals during the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS: We used individual level data on registered travellers linked with data on COVID-19 testing and confirmed COVID-19 cases. The proportions of confirmed cases among international travellers before and after the requirement were introduced was analysed with an interrupted times series design. RESULTS: The proportion of travellers with an EU COVID-19 certificate tested at an official test station increased from 3% to 43% after mandatory testing was introduced. However, the proportion of all travellers confirmed with COVID-19 rose only marginally with 0.14 percentage point directly after the intervention (p-value .06).

In this study, we have aimed at differentially investigating the impact of COVID-19 vaccines (CoronaVac, Pfizer/BioNTech, Astra/Zeneca Oxford, Janssen) used in North Cyprus in limiting the viral load of Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-COV-2. We have utilized real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold values (Ct values) as a proxy of viral load of the two SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results indicate that the administration of at least two doses of the messenger RNA-based Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine leads to the lowest viral load (highest Ct values) obtained for both Omicron and Delta variants. Interestingly, regardless of the vaccine type used, our study revealed that Delta variant produced significantly higher viral loads (lower Ct values) compared with the Omicron variant, where the latter was more commonly associated with younger patients.

A failure to stop growth of COVID-19-linked morbidity rates is caused by SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the emergence of new highly virulent SARS-CoV-2 strains. Several acquired SARS-CoV-2 mutations reflect viral adaptations to host immune defence. Mutations in the virus Spike-protein were associated with the lowered effectiveness of current preventive therapies, including vaccines. Recent in vitro studies detected diminished neutralisation capacity of vaccine-induced antibodies, which are targeted to bind Spike receptor-binding and N-terminal domains in the emerging strains. Lower than expected inhibitory activity of antibodies was reported against viruses with E484K Spike mutation, including B.1.1.7 (UK), P.1 (Brazil), B.1.351 (South African), and new Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) with E484A mutation. The vaccine effectiveness is yet to be examined against new mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 originating in Europe, Nigeria, Brazil, South Africa, and India. To prevent the loss of anti-viral protection in vivo, often defined as antibody resistance, it is required to target highly conserved viral sequences (including Spike protein) and enhance the potency of antibody cocktails.

The median decrease rate of S-ab levels in 5 months was 50.3% (IQR 40.3-62.6) and those differences were not observed among all generations. Gender-associated differences in S-ab levels were not observed; however, a significant relationship between higher S-ab levels and the systemic adverse reactions was observed at both measurements.

While mRNA-1273 demonstrated high efficacy in prevention of COVID-19, including severe disease, its effect on the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections is not understood. Here, in exploratory analyses, we assessed the impact of mRNA-1273 vaccination in the ongoing COVE trial (number NCT04470427) on SARS-CoV-2 copy number and shedding, burden of disease and infection, and viral variants. Viral variants were sequenced in all COVID-19 and adjudicated COVID-19 cases (n = 832), from July 2020 in the blinded part A of the study to May 2021 of the open-label part B of the study, in which participants in the placebo arm started to receive the mRNA-1273 vaccine after US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization of mRNA-1273 in December 2020. mRNA-1273 vaccination significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral copy number (95% confidence interval) by 100-fold on the day of diagnosis compared with placebo (4.1 (3.4-4.8) versus 6.2 (6.0-6.4) log(10) copies per ml). Median times to undetectable viral copies were 4 days for mRNA-1273 and 7 days for placebo. Vaccination also substantially reduced the burden of disease and infection scores.

The detection of other, non-SARS-CoV-2, respiratory viruses during the trial was similar between groups.

The pooled Effectiveness/Efficacy with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) with Metaprop order was calculated. The results were presented in forest plots. Predefined subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: A total of twenty articles were included in this meta-analysis. After the first dose of the vaccine, the total effectiveness of all COVID-19 vaccines in our study was 71% (95% CI 0.65, 0.78). The total effectiveness of vaccines after the second dose was 91% (95% CI 0.88, 0.94)). The total efficacy of vaccines after the first and second doses was 81% (95% CI 0.70, 0.91) and 71% (95% CI 0.62, 0.79), respectively. The effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine after the first and second dose was the highest among other studied vaccines ((74% (95% CI, 0.65, 0.83) and 93% (95% CI, 0.89, 0.97), respectively).

Moreover, occasional but increasing reports of endocrine disorders involving the thyroid have been reported after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Among them, a few cases encompass the pituitary. Here we report a rare case of central diabetes insipidus following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 59-year-old female patient with a 25-year history of Crohn's disease in long-term remission, who presented with sudden onset of polyuria eight weeks after administration of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Laboratory evaluation was consistent with isolated central diabetes insipidus. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed involvement of the infundibulum and the posterior hypophysis. Eighteen months after the vaccination, she is still under desmopressin treatment and had stable pituitary stalk thickening on magnetic resonance imaging. Although Crohn's disease-associated hypophysitis has been reported, it is scarce. In the absence of other recognizable causes of hypophysitis, we believe the involvement of the hypophysis in our patient may have been triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

METHODS: The newly developed salivary antigen test kit \"Inspecter Kowa(R) SARS-CoV-2\" is an ICT to which saliva specimens can be directly applied. We evaluated its usefulness in comparison with reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and the Espline(R) SARS-CoV-2 Kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swab specimens. In this study, 140 patients with suspected symptomatic COVID-19 who visited our hospital were enrolled, and nasopharyngeal swab and saliva specimens were collected after they consented to participate in the study. RESULTS: Inspector Kowa SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 45 of 61 (73.8%) saliva that were positive by RT-qPCR and the Espline(R) SARS-CoV-2 Kit was also positive in 56 of 60 (93.3%) Np swabs that were positive by RT-qPCR. Good antigen detection was achieved by ICT with saliva and nasopharyngeal swab specimens when viral load was >/=10(5) copies/mL, whereas detection sensitivity was low when viral load was <10(5) copies/mL, especially in saliva specimens.

Given the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to develop new variants, the implementation of an effective and long-term herd immunity appears to be crucial to overcome the pandemic. While a vast field of research has focused on the role of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2, a growing body of evidence suggest that antibodies alone only confer a partial protection against infection of reinfection which could be of high importance regarding the strategic development goals (SDG) of the United Nations (UN) and in particular UN SDG3 that aims towards the realization of good health and well being on a global scale in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.In this review, we highlight the role of humoral immunity in the host defense against SARS-CoV-2, with a focus on highly neutralizing antibodies. We summarize the results of the main clinical trials leading to an overall disappointing efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy, variable results of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies in patients with COVID-19 but outstanding results for the mRNA based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we advocate that beyond antibody responses, the development of a robust cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after infection or vaccination is of utmost importance for promoting immune memory and limiting disease severity, especially in case of (re)-infection by variant viruses.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36422774/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1007/s12015-022-10477-y https://sci-hub.do/10477 https://sci-hub.do/10.1007/s12015-022-10477-y", "pt": "Journal Article; Review", "pl": "United States", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35987747, "aid": "S0929-6646(22)00283-2 10.1016/j.jfma.2022.07.010", "titl": "Serological response and safety of heterologous ChAdOx1-nCoV-19/mRNA-1273 prime-boost vaccination with a twelve-week interval.", "mesh": "Adult;;; Humans;;; 2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; Vaccination;;; Adenoviridae;;; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19;;; Immunoglobulin G;;; *Viral Vaccines;;; Antibodies, Neutralizing;;; Antibodies, Viral", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Sheng, Wang-Huei; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Hsieh, Ming-Ju; Ieong, Si-Man; Chang, Shan-Chwen", "jour": "Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi", "affl": "Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei City, Taiwan.;;; Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan.;;; Department of Emergency Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Occupational Safety and Health Office, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.;;; Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei City, Taiwan.

The development of cost-effective vaccines seems to be the only solution to terminate this pandemic. However, the vaccines' effectiveness has been questioned due to recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Most of the mutations are associated with the spike protein, a vital target for several marketed vaccines. Many countries were highly affected by the 2nd wave of the SARS-CoV-2, like the UK, India, Brazil and France. Experts are also alarming the further COVID-19 wave with the emergence of Omicron, which is highly affecting the South African populations. This review encompasses the detailed description of all vaccine candidates and COVID-19 mutants that will add value to design further studies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The information was generated using various search engines like google scholar, PubMed, clinicaltrial.gov.in, WHO database, ScienceDirect, and news portals by using keywords SARS-CoV-2 mutants, COVID-19 vaccines, efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, COVID-19 waves. RESULTS: This review has highlighted the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the vaccine efficacy. Currently, various vaccine candidates are undergoing several phases of development. Their efficacy still needs to check for newly emerged variants. We have focused on the evolution, multiple mutants, waves of the SARS-CoV-2, and different marketed vaccines undergoing various clinical trials and the design of the trials to determine vaccine efficacy. CONCLUSION: Various mutants of SARS-CoV-2 arrived, mainly concerned with the spike protein, a key component to design the vaccine candidates. Various vaccines are undergoing clinical trial and show impressive results, but their efficacy still needs to be checked in different SARS-CoV-2 mutants. We discussed all mutants of SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccine's efficacy against them. The safety concern of these vaccines is also discussed. It is important to understand how coronavirus gets mutated to design better new vaccines, providing long-term protection and neutralizing broad mutant variants. A proper study approach also needs to be considered while designing the vaccine efficacy trials, which further improved the study outcomes.

We assessed humoral (anti-spike-RBD-IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and avidity) and cellular (spike-induced T-cell interferon-gamma release) immune responses in blood samples up to 2 weeks before (T1) and 2-12 weeks following secondary immunization (T2). RESULTS: Initial vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 resulted in lower anti-spike-RBD-IgG compared with BNT162b2 (70 +/- 114 vs. 226 +/- 279 BAU/ml, p < .01) at T1. Booster vaccination with BNT162b2 proved superior to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at T2 (anti-spike-RBD-IgG: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2 2387 +/- 1627 and homologous BNT162b2 3202 +/- 2184 vs. homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 413 +/- 461 BAU/ml, both p < .001; spike-induced T-cell interferon-gamma release: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2 5069 +/- 6733 and homologous BNT162b2 4880 +/- 7570 vs. homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 1152 +/- 2243 mIU/ml, both p < .001). No significant differences were detected between BNT162b2-boostered groups at T2. For ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, no booster effect on T-cell activation could be observed. We found associations between anti-spike-RBD-IgG levels (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2 and homologous BNT162b2) and T-cell responses (homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2) from T1 to T2. Additionally, anti-spike-RBD-IgG and T-cell response were linked at both time points (all groups combined). All regimes yielded neutralizing antibodies and increased antibody avidity at T2.

The vaccination of pregnant women cannot only avoid or reduce the probability of infectious diseases, but also offers the most effective and direct protection for neonates by means of passive immunization. However, there is no randomized clinical data to ascertain whether the inactivated vaccination of pregnant women or women of childbearing age can affect conception and the fetus. We found that human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mice that were vaccinated with two doses of CoronaVac (an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) before and during pregnancy exhibited normal weight changes and reproductive performance indices; the physical development of their offspring was also normal. Following intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, pregnant mice in the immunization group all survived; reproductive performance indices and the physical development of offspring were all normal.

In order to gain insight into the emergence and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the South American region, a comprehensive phylogenetic study of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in this region was performed. The results of these studies revealed sharp increase in virus effective population size from March to April of 2020. At least 62 different genotypes were found to circulate in this region. Variants of concern (VOCs) Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta co-circulate in the region, together with variants of interest (VOIs) Lambda, Mu and Zeta. Most of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the South American region belongs to B.1 genotypes and have substitutions in the spike and/or nucleocapsid and polymerase proteins that confer high transmissibility and/or immune resistance. 148 amino acid positions of the spike protein and 70 positions of the nucleocapsid were found to have substitutions in different variants isolated in the region by comparison with reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1.

We investigated the effects of the third dose of the mRNA vaccine on antibody titer and the factors associated with antibody production in patients with RA who had previously received two doses of the ChAdOx1-S nCoV-19 vaccine. METHODS: Between October 14, 2021 and June 17, 2022, two patient groups diagnosed with RA were recruited prospectively: one with two doses of ChAdOx1-S nCoV-19 and the second group with the additional third mRNA vaccine. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody titers were determined through semiquantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Antibody titers were compared in both groups considering clinical features and medications. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with antibody production. Also, we followed up the antibody titers of whom completed the 3rd mRNA vaccination. RESULTS: Among 261 patients, all patients were over 60 years old except for 7 patients and the average age was 65 years; 153 had completed two doses of ChAdOx1-S nCoV-19, while 108 patients had also received the third mRNA vaccine. The positive rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1/receptor binding domain-specific antibody (titer > 0.8 U/mL) were 97% (149/153) and 99% (107/108) respectively. However, positive rates for high antibody titer (> 250 U/mL) were found in only 31% (47/153) of group 1 but 94% (102/108) of group 2. Multivariate analysis revealed that corticosteroid use (odds ratio [OR], 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.75), older age (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.860-0.98), and male sex (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.74) were associated with a lower rate of high antibody titer acquisition after two doses of ChAdOx1-S nCoV-19. Waning of antibody titers was observed in only two of 46 patients who followed up twice after the third mRNA vaccine inoculation.

We also sought to summarise evidence on vaccine safety in relation to cardiovascular and neurological complications. In order to do so, we drew primarily on evidence from two our own data platforms and supplement these with insights from related large population-based studies and systematic reviews. RECENT FINDINGS: All studies showed high vaccine effectiveness against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and in particular against COVID-19 hospitalisation and death. However, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 infection waned over time. These studies also found that booster vaccines would be needed to maintain high vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 outcomes.

Today, several different types of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed worldwide. These vaccines are usually administered in a two-dose schedule, and the third dose is currently being administered in most countries. This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the immunogenicity of heterologous vs. homologous vaccination after administration of the third dose of COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: Electronic databases and websites including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google scholar were searched for relevant randomized clinical trial (RCT) studies. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of three RCTs were included in the study. These RCTs were included 2,613 healthy adults (18 years or older and without a history of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19) with 15 heterologous and five homologous prime-boost vaccination regimens. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike IgG levels at day 28 after administration of the third dose, were compared between the heterologous and homologous regimens. RESULTS: The highest antibody responses had been reported for the homologous vaccination regimen of m1273/m1273/m1273 (Moderna), followed by the heterologous regimen of BNT/BNT/m1273. In addition, the immunogenicity of viral vector and inactivated vaccines was remarkably enhanced when they had been boosted by a heterologous vaccine, especially mRNA vaccines. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that mRNA vaccines in a homologous regimen induce strong antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 compared to other vaccine platforms. In contrast, viral vector and inactivated vaccines show a satisfactory immunogenicity in a heterologous regimen, especially in combination with mRNA vaccines.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36711369/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fpubh.2022.960598", "pt": "Meta-Analysis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Systematic Review", "pl": "Switzerland", "topic": 2, "prop": 0.9606026572536766}, {"uid": 37378775, "aid": "10.1007/978-3-031-28012-2_17", "titl": "Machine Learning and COVID-19: Lessons from SARS-CoV-2.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *COVID-19;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Machine Learning;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Systems Biology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Avila-Ponce de Leon, Ugo; Vazquez-Jimenez, Aaron; Cervera, Alejandra; Resendis-Gonzalez, Galilea; Neri-Rosario, Daniel; Resendis-Antonio, Osbaldo", "jour": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "affl": "Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.;;; Human Systems Biology Laboratory, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.;;; Human Systems Biology Laboratory, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.;;; Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.;;; Human Systems Biology Laboratory, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.;;; Human Systems Biology Laboratory, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.;;; Human Systems Biology Laboratory, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. oresendis@inmegen.gob.mx.;;; Coordinacion de la Investigacion Cientifica - Red de Apoyo a la Investigacion - Centro de Ciencias de la Complejidad, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. oresendis@inmegen.gob.mx.", "pdat": "2023", "tiab": "Currently, methods in machine learning have opened a significant number of applications to construct classifiers with capacities to recognize, identify, and interpret patterns hidden in massive amounts of data.

In this chapter, we present some supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques that have contributed in three aspects to supplying information to health authorities and diminishing the deadly effects of the current worldwide outbreak on the population. First is the identification and construction of powerful classifiers capable of predicting severe, moderate, or asymptomatic responses in COVID-19 patients starting from clinical or high-throughput technologies.

However, data regarding COVID-19 vaccine safety and immune response in cancer patients are scarce. METHOD: This prospective, age- and sex-matched, single-center cohort study included 61 cancer patients and 122 healthy control participants. Seropositivity was defined as anti-S IgG titer >0.8 units/ml. Primary end point was seroconversion rate of immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein (anti-S IgG) in cancer patients vs. healthy control participants following the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). RESULTS: After the second-dose vaccination, there was no difference in seropositivity rate between groups (57 [93.44%] patients with cancer vs. 121 [99.18%] control participants; geometric mean ratio [GMR]: 0.39; 95%CI: 0.01-10.46; p-value = 0.571). In contrast, after the first-dose vaccination, the seropositivity rate was significantly lower in the cancer patients than in the control participants (50/61 [81.97%] vs. 121/122 [99.18%]; GMR: 0.07; 95%CI: 0.01-0.71; p = 0.025). The median anti-S IgG titer after the first-and second dose vaccination were not significantly different between groups. Female sex was significantly associated with a higher anti-S IgG titer. 5FU- and taxane-based chemotherapy regimens were associated with a lower IgG titer. Side effects of vaccination were tolerable.

METHODS: Immunocompetent adults who received a booster dose of mRNA-1273 from October 2021 through December 2021 were matched 1:1 to randomly selected 2-dose mRNA-1273 recipients by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and second-dose date and followed up through January 2022. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing outcomes (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection and coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] hospitalization and hospital death) in the booster-dose and 2-dose groups. Adjusted rVE (%) was calculated as (1 - aHR) x 100. aHRs and rVE were also estimated by subgroup and month of follow-up. RESULTS: The study included 431 328 booster-dose vaccinated adults matched to 431 328 2-dose vaccinated adults. rVE was 61.3% (95% CI: 60.5%-62.2%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 89.0% (86.2%-91.2%) against COVID-19 hospitalization, and 96.0% (68.0%-99.5%) against COVID-19 hospital death. rVE against SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 55.6% to 66.7% across all subgroups. rVE against SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased from 67.1% (0 to <1 month of follow-up) to 30.5% (2 to <3 months). For COVID-19 hospitalization, rVE decreased from 91.2% (0 to <1 month) to 78.7% (2 to <3 months).

Indeed, it is not clear whether asthma is among the risk factors for the occurrence of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, or rather it plays a protective role against the worsening of the respiratory involvement in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, the extent to which coronavirus infection may trigger asthma attacks is still partly unknown. The current investigation aims at reviewing the available literature on the topic to address factors influencing this relationship. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on recent observations, it is likely that type 2 inflammation plays a protective role against SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. In particular, asthmatics show different expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that are responsible for a reduced risk of infection as well as lower risk of hospitalization. Interestingly, studies showed a safe profile of inhaled corticosteroids and biological drugs in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, inhaled corticosteroid could play a protective role against worsening of asthma. SUMMARY: The current findings suggest that current treatment for asthma should be maintained to avoid severe exacerbations. Severe asthmatics under biological treatment should continue their medications, and be encouraged to receive COVID-19 vaccines.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36752375/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/00130832-202304000-00020 https://sci-hub.do/10.1097/ACI.0000000000000893", "pt": "Journal Article; Review", "pl": "United States", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35984031, "aid": "IDDT-EPUB-125589 10.2174/1871526522666220818124416", "titl": "Latest in COVID-19 Vaccine 'Candidates' Race.", "mesh": "Humans;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; *Viral Vaccines;;; Pandemics/prevention & control", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Atoum, Manar Fayiz; Zreig, Dalia Abu; Abu Zreig, Laith Majed", "jour": "Infectious disorders drug targets", "affl": "Faculty of Applied Health Sciences, Medical Laboratory Science, Hashemite University, Zarqa, Jordan.;;; Faculty of Medicine, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Ar-Ramtha, Jordan.;;; Faculty of Medicine, Ophthalmology, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Jordan.", "pdat": "2023", "tiab": "Restoring everyday civil life from the devastating pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be only by the development of an efficient vaccine.

The causative organism was initially named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 n CoV) but has subsequently been renamed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic has so far infected several millions and killed about a million people worldwide. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To examine the critical role diabetes plays in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19 and to assess the emerging therapies available to fight the pandemic. METHODS: Authors conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine the role of diabetes as comorbidity in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19 by searching PubMed and Science Direct databases mainly for articles published since the outbreak of the pandemic. RESULTS: Both experimental and observational data from early 2020 suggested that most people with COVID-19 have comorbidities, the most dominant of which are diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Empirical evidence indicates that diabetic patients infected with the COVID-19 disease had the worst outcomes concerning morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: A combination of underlying chronic conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases together with altered ACE receptor expression, immune dysregulation via cytokine storm, alveolar and endothelial dysfunction, increased systemic coagulation may put individuals with diabetes at risk for COVID-19 severity. More studies are needed to elucidate how glucose- lowering drugs may modulate the host immune response in diabetic individuals, especially following the administration of potential COVID-19 vaccines.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34365925/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/CDR-EPUB-117126 https://sci-hub.do/10.2174/1573399817666210806104349", "pt": "Journal Article;

Infected individuals emit volatile organic compounds in their breath and sweat that are detectable by trained dogs. Here, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of dog detection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fifteen dogs previously trained at two centres in Australia were presented to axillary sweat specimens collected from known SARS-CoV-2 human cases (n = 100) and non-cases (n = 414). The true infection status of the cases and non-cases were confirmed based on RT-PCR results as well as clinical presentation. Across dogs, the overall diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) was 95.3% (95%CI: 93.1-97.6%) and diagnostic specificity (DSp) was 97.1% (95%CI: 90.7-100.0%). The DSp decreased significantly when non-case specimens were collected over 1 min rather than 20 min (p value = .004). The location of evaluation did not impact the detection performances.

Global vaccine development is the most promising cost-effective method for overcoming the epidemic. However, following reports of post-vaccination thromboembolic adverse effects, there have been raising concerns about the safety profile of the COVID-19 vaccine. AREAS COVERED: We aimed to review the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines and identify the organ-based major complications of COVID-19 vaccines based on reliable published studies. To find high-quality and large-scale observational, clinical trial, and cohort studies, PubMED, Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science were searched using keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, vaccine, Pfizer (BNT162b2), Johnson and Johnson (Ad26.COV2), Moderna (mRNA-1273), Oxford AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1nCoV19), Coronavac (Sinovac), BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), adverse effect, and complication. To include all relevant articles, backward searching was also done on similar article citations. Case reports, studies including less than 10 participants, and biased articles were excluded. EXPERT OPINION: Based on data from high-quality and population-based studies, major adverse effects are divided into four major organ-specific groups, including cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic, and immune-allergic side effects. The incidence of most of these side effects is not different between vaccinated and normal populations, and currently, the benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 are greater than the mortality and morbidity risks of COVID-19 infection. However, further studies, specifically systematic review and meta-analysis, are still indicated to investigate further unknown side effects of these vaccines and the existence of causality between the vaccine and reported adverse events.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35986451/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1080/14760584.2022.2116008", "pt": "Journal Article; Review", "pl": "England", "topic": 0, "prop": 0.8551674580986315}, {"uid": 35838970, "aid": "10.1007/978-1-0716-2395-4_23", "titl": "Evaluation Protocol for SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays.", "mesh": "Antibodies, Viral;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Humans;;; Immunoassay/methods;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; Sensitivity and Specificity", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Gededzha, Maemu P; Jugwanth, Sarika; Mampeule, Nakampe; Zwane, Nontobeko; David, Anura; Scott, Lesley; Stevens, Wendy; Mayne, Elizabeth S", "jour": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "affl": "Department of Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.

However, the relationship between the use of PPIs and the adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently inconclusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between the use of PPIs and the in-hospital mortality among patients who were laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Data was derived from 2 hospitals which both were the first batch of SARS-CoV-2 specialist hospitals with four types of sensitivity analyses. This cohort included 4634 patients older than 18 years who were laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Endpoints were death in hospital (primary) and the recovery of COVID-19 (secondary: the time of COVID-19 nucleic acid testing turning negative). RESULTS: In the entire cohort, there were 3588 non-users, 399 </= 0.5 defined daily dose (DDD) PPIs users, 483 1 DDD users, and 164 >/= 1.5 DDD users. The multivariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio (OR) = 3.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.83-7.23, P = 0.0002) and four types of sensitivity analyses showed higher mortality in patients using PPIs during hospitalization, while the relationship between different PPIs dosages and the hospital mortality remained insignificant. Usage of the PPIs significantly prolongs the time of COVID-19 nucleic acid testing turning negative. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PPIs may increase the risk of in-hospital death of patients who were laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, which means that physicians may need to re-evaluate the benefit-risk assessment of the use of PPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35198150/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/jogh-12-05005 https://sci-hub.do/10.7189/jogh.12.05005", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Scotland", "topic": 3, "prop": 0.9652318916936261}, {"uid": 36031500, "aid": "S0264-410X(22)01011-8 10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.08.033", "titl": "Comparison of the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a reduced and standard booster dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults after two doses of inactivated vaccine.", "mesh": "2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273;;; Adult;;; Antibodies, Viral;;; Arthralgia;;; BNT162 Vaccine;;; *COVID-19/prevention & control;;; *COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects;;; Humans;;; Immunization, Secondary;;; Immunogenicity, Vaccine;;; RNA, Messenger;;; SARS-CoV-2;;; Vaccines, Inactivated/adverse effects", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Kanokudom, Sitthichai; Assawakosri, Suvichada; Suntronwong, Nungruthai; Chansaenroj, Jira; Auphimai, Chompoonut; Nilyanimit, Pornjarim; Vichaiwattana, Preeyaporn; Thongmee, Thanunrat; Yorsaeng, Ritthideach; Duangchinda, Thaneeya; Chantima, Warangkana; Pakchotanon, Pattarakul; Srimuan, Donchida; Thatsanatorn, Thaksaporn; Klinfueng, Sirapa; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Sudhinaraset, Natthinee; Wanlapakorn, Nasamon; Honsawek, Sittisak; Poovorawan, Yong", "jour": "Vaccine", "affl": "Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeleton, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; Center of Excellence in Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeleton, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Molecular Biology of Dengue and Flaviviruses Research Team, National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Development Agency, NSTDA, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.;;; Division of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Research, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand; Siriraj Center of Research Excellence in Dengue and Emerging Pathogens, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.;;; Molecular Biology of Dengue and Flaviviruses Research Team, National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Development Agency, NSTDA, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7BN, UK; Chinese Academy of Medical Science (CAMS) Oxford Institute (COI), University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.;;; Center of Excellence in Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeleton, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.

In this study, the serologic response to a third dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was measured in 78 lung transplant recipients. Sixty-two percent (n = 48) had a serological response to vaccination, which was significantly higher than after the second vaccine dose (27 patients (35%); p = 0.0013). A positive serologic response was associated with having had COVID-19 (p = 0.01), and higher serum IgG level and complement mannose binding lectin pathway activity prior to vaccination (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively). Serologic response was not associated with the dose of mycophenolate mofetil or prednisone or other immune status parameters.

Therefore, vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have recently emerged as an important measure to fight the pandemic. ChAdOx1-S (Oxford-AstraZeneca) is an adenovirus-vectored vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It shows an acceptable safety profile. Nevertheless, several cases of unusual thrombosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported after initial vaccination with ChAdOx1-S mimicking autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This condition has been called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) and complications such as intracerebral haemorrhage have been described. CASE REPORT: We present a case of intracerebral haemorrhage after ChAdOx1-S vaccination. Middle-aged patient with no prior medical history was seen in the emergency room 16 days after the first dose of ChAdOx1-S vaccine with sudden onset left hemiplegia and severe holocranial oppressive headache. She did not receive heparin treatment in the previous 100 days. Blood test showed moderate thrombocytopenia and a right frontal lobar haemorrhage was seen on computed tomography scan, computed tomography venography was negative for thrombosis. The presence of antibodies against platelet factor 4 was confirmed. The patient's neurological condition progressively worsened. She developed a treatment resistant intracranial hypertension syndrome and she died three weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: TTS is a rare adverse effect of ChAdOx1-S vaccine, defined by the presence of thrombosis in uncommon locations.

However, uncertainty remains over how long primary vaccination series remain effective, the ideal timing for booster doses, and the safety of heterologous booster regimens. We aimed to investigate COVID-19 primary vaccine series effectiveness and its waning, and the safety and effectiveness of booster doses, in a UK community setting. METHODS: We used SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in individuals from a longitudinal, prospective, community-based study (ZOE COVID Study), in which data were self-reported through an app, to assess the effectiveness of three COVID-19 vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCov19 [Oxford-AstraZeneca], BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNtech], and mRNA1273 [Moderna]) against infection in the 8 months after completion of primary vaccination series. In individuals receiving boosters, we investigated vaccine effectiveness and reactogenicity, by assessing 16 self-reported systemic and localised side-effects. We used multivariate Poisson regression models adjusting for confounders to estimate vaccine effectiveness. FINDINGS: We included 620 793 participants who received two vaccine doses (204 731 [33.0%] received BNT162b2, 405 239 [65.3%] received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and 10 823 [1.7%] received mRNA-1273) and subsequently had a SARS-CoV-2 test result between May 23 (chosen to exclude the period of alpha [B.1.1.7] variant dominance) and Nov 23, 2021. 62 172 (10.0%) vaccinated individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were compared with 40 345 unvaccinated controls (6726 [16.7%] of whom tested positive). Vaccine effectiveness waned after the second dose: at 5 months, BNT162b2 effectiveness was 82.1% (95% CI 81.3-82.9), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 effectiveness was 75.7% (74.9-76.4), and mRNA-1273 effectiveness was 84.3% (81.2-86.9). Vaccine effectiveness decreased more among individuals aged 55 years or older and among those with comorbidities. 135 932 individuals aged 55 years or older received a booster (2123 [1.6%] of whom tested positive). Vaccine effectiveness for booster doses in 0-3 months after BNT162b2 primary vaccination was higher than 92.5%, and effectiveness for heterologous boosters after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was at least 88.8%. For the booster reactogenicity analysis, in 317 011 participants, the most common systemic symptom was fatigue (in 31 881 [10.1%] participants) and the most common local symptom was tenderness (in 187 767 [59.2%]). Systemic side-effects were more common for heterologous schedules (32 632 [17.9%] of 182 374) than for homologous schedules (17 707 [13.2%] of 134 637; odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.5-1.6, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: After 5 months, vaccine effectiveness remained high among individuals younger than 55 years. Booster doses restore vaccine effectiveness. Adverse reactions after booster doses were similar to those after the second dose. Homologous booster schedules had fewer reported systemic side-effects than heterologous boosters.

In this study, we aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests and the factors that cause nonspecific reactions. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n = 100), sputum specimens (n = 10), and lithium-heparin plasma samples (n = 100) were collected. We evaluated Espline(R)SARS-CoV-2 (Espline) and SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test that also known as STANDARD Q(R) (STANDARD Q), with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Lumipulse(R) Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag as reference tests. In addition, we investigated the effects of inadequate pretreatment methods and five potential causes of nonspecific reactions. RESULTS: The sensitivities of Espline and STANDARD Q were 60% and 57%, respectively, and their specificity was 100%. It was confirmed that the judgment line for the positive insufficiently mixed specimens was faint. A false-positive result was observed with STANDARD Q when sputum was used as a specimen to investigate judgment the effect of viscosity. CONCLUSIONS: Espline and STANDARD Q show good sensitivity for specimens with Ct values less than 25, but specimens collected within 9 days of symptom onset may still give false negatives.

The present study was aimed to assess these objectives. METHODS: Fifty real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19-infected individuals, along with 90 COVID-19-naive (BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCov-19)-vaccinated individuals, were included in the study. Individuals who received a single dose of either vaccine with a confirmed past diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=15) were also included. Blood samples were collected strictly between the 4(th) and 5(th) wk after development of symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and after the first/second vaccination dose. Antibody profile assessment was done using whole-virus, spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid-specific ELISA kits along with neutralizing antibody kit. RESULTS: There was an overall 97.7 per cent seropositivity rate in vaccinated individuals, and a strong correlation (R(2)=0.8, P<0.001) between neutralizing and spike-RBD antibodies. Among individuals who received two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the spike antibody levels developed were of higher titre with a longer prime boost interval than in those with shorter intervals (P<0.01). Individuals vaccinated with two doses as well as only one dose post-SARS-CoV-2 infection had high neutralizing and spike-specific antibodies. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: High neutralizing and spike-specific antibodies were developed in individuals vaccinated only with one dose of either vaccine post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine and Oxford-Astra Zenecaa chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine have been approved to be used in Kuwait since December 2021. PWMS registered in Kuwait national registry were contacted by phone, WhatsApp, or through face-to-face interviews and were invited to complete our questionnaire. Demographic, clinical data, symptoms following the vaccine, worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms, and occurrence of relapse were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 820 PWMS, 647 completed the questionnaire.

Tixagevimab/cilgavimab, the only monoclonal antibody combination authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), demonstrated efficacy in unvaccinated individuals in the PROVENT study. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses predominantly on real-world evidence examining the effectiveness and safety of tixagevimab/cilgavimab in populations who are immunocompromised and otherwise vulnerable. The ability of tixagevimab/cilgavimab to neutralize Omicron subvariants, the appropriate dosage in vulnerable populations, and the impact of prior vaccination on tixagevimab/cilgavimab effectiveness are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The tixagevimab/cilgavimab combination is important in providing protection in people who either cannot have a full vaccination or respond poorly to COVID-19 vaccines. Abundant clinical data have emerged to inform clinical use in adults in need, although some additional data-formal pediatric and adolescent studies, plus information on optimal doses required to protect against emerging variants, and the ideal interval between tixagevimab/cilgavimab dosing and vaccination-would be welcomed. Importantly, despite the current effectiveness of tixagevimab/cilgavimab, we must recognize the possibility that resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants could emerge in the future.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36217836/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1080/14787210.2022.2134118", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review", "pl": "England", "topic": 0, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 36849344, "aid": "10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20221228-01069", "titl": "[Recommendations for early identification, diagnosis and treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection in children].", "mesh": "Child;;; Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis/therapy;;; COVID-19 Testing", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "\u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044b", "jour": "Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics", "affl": "\u0431\u0435\u0437 AD", "pdat": "2023 Mar 2", "tiab": "\u0431\u0435\u0437 AB", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36849344/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20221228-01069", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "China", "topic": 6, "prop": 0.17633304855256524}, {"uid": 32677533, "aid": "1792347 10.1080/07391102.2020.1792347", "titl": "Designing a multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: an immunoinformatics approach.", "mesh": "*COVID-19;;; COVID-19 Vaccines;;; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte;;; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte;;; Humans;;; Molecular Docking Simulation;;; *SARS-CoV-2", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Samad, Abdus; Ahammad, Foysal; Nain, Zulkar; Alam, Rahat; Imon, Raihan Rahman; Hasan, Mahadi; Rahman, Md Shahedur", "jour": "Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics", "affl": "Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Jashore University of Science and Technology, Jashore, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Jashore University of Science and Technology, Jashore, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Biological Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, East West University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Islamic University, Kushtia, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Jashore University of Science and Technology, Jashore, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Jashore University of Science and Technology, Jashore, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Jashore University of Science and Technology, Jashore, Bangladesh.;;; Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Jashore University of Science and Technology, Jashore, Bangladesh.", "pdat": "2022 Jan", "tiab": "Ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has raised a drastic challenge to global public health security. Most of the patients with COVID-19 suffer from mild flu-like illnesses such as cold and fever; however, few percentages of the patients progress from severe illness to death, mostly in an immunocompromised individual. The causative agent of COVID-19 is an RNA virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite these debilitating conditions, no medication to stop the disease progression or vaccination is available till now. Therefore, we aimed to formulate a multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing an immunoinformatics approach. For this purpose, we used the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to determine the immunodominant T- and B-cell epitopes. After rigorous assessment, we designed a vaccine construct using four potential epitopes from each of the three epitope classes such as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, helper T-lymphocyte, and linear B-lymphocyte epitopes. The designed vaccine was antigenic, immunogenic, and non-allergenic with suitable physicochemical properties and has higher solubility. More importantly, the predicted vaccine structure was similar to the native protein. Further investigations indicated a strong and stable binding interaction between the vaccine and the toll-like receptor (TLR4). Strong binding stability and structural compactness were also evident in molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the computer-generated immune simulation showed that the vaccine could trigger real-life-like immune responses upon administration into humans. Finally, codon optimization based on Escherichia coli K12 resulted in optimal GC content and higher CAI value followed by incorporating it into the cloning vector pET28+(a). Overall, these results suggest that the designed peptide vaccine can serve as an excellent prophylactic candidate against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Self-Defense Forces large-scale vaccination center in Tokyo, Japan, from May 24 to November 30, 2021. Participants were recipients of the second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine who had received the first dose 4 to 6 weeks earlier. Five experienced dermatologists interviewed participants to assess whether they had experienced symptoms of DLLR after administration of the first dose of the vaccine. EXPOSURE: Receipt of the first dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence rate of DLLR stratified by sex and age group. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to evaluate the differences between groups. Outcomes were tested for significance using the Pearson chi2 test with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Of 5893 participants in the study, 3318 (56.3%) were male (median age, 55 years [IQR, 38-68 years]) and 2575 (43.7%) were female (median age, 50 years [IQR, 34-67 years]). A total of 747 participants (12.7%) experienced DLLR symptoms after the first dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Symptoms were mild and not considered as contraindications to the vaccine. The incidence rate was significantly higher among females (22.4% [577 participants]; OR, 5.30; 95% CI, 4.42-6.34) than among males (5.1% [170 participants]; reference). Moreover, the incidence rate was significantly higher among participants aged 30 to 39 years (14.3% [129 participants]; OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.25-2.26), 40 to 49 years (15.8% [136 participants]; OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.41-2.53), 50 to 59 years (14.9% [104 participants]; OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.29-2.40), and 60 to 69 years (12.6% [182 participants]; OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10-1.91) than among participants aged 18 to 29 years (9.0% [81 participants]; reference). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the first dose of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine was associated with a higher incidence of DLLR among females and among individuals aged 30 to 69 years.

Recently, a novel complication of SARS-CoV-2-targeted adenovirus vaccines has emerged: immune thrombocytopenia, either isolated, or accompanied by thrombosis (then termed VITT). This complication is characterized by low platelet counts, and in the case of VITT, also by platelet-activating platelet factor 4 antibodies reminiscent of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, leading to a prothrombotic state with clot formation at unusual anatomic sites. Here, we detected antiplatelet antibodies targeting platelet glycoprotein receptors in 30% of patients with proven VITT (n = 27) and 42% of patients with isolated thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination (n = 26), indicating broad antiplatelet autoimmunity in these clinical entities. We use in vitro and in vivo models to characterize possible mechanisms of these platelet-targeted autoimmune responses leading to thrombocytopenia. We show that IV but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation in mice. After IV injection, these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen, and platelet remnants are found in the marginal zone and follicles. This is followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating antibodies binding to platelets. Our work contributes to the understanding of platelet-associated complications after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 administration and highlights accidental IV injection as a potential mechanism of platelet-targeted autoimmunity. Hence, preventing IV injection when administering adenovirus-based vaccines could be a potential measure against platelet-associated pathologies after vaccination.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486845/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0006-4971(22)00609-7 https://sci-hub.do/2022/BLD2021014712 https://sci-hub.do/10.1182/blood.2021014712", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": -1, "prop": 0.0}, {"uid": 37276183, "aid": "PONE-D-22-32449 10.1371/journal.pone.0285083", "titl": "Optimal allocation of scarce PCR tests during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *SARS-CoV-2/genetics;;; *COVID-19/diagnosis/epidemiology;;; COVID-19 Testing/methods;;; Pandemics;;; Sensitivity and Specificity;;; Polymerase Chain Reaction", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Gandjour, Afschin", "jour": "PloS one", "affl": "Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany.", "pdat": "2023", "tiab": "BACKGROUND/AIM: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Germany and various other countries experienced a shortage of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory tests due to the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant that drove an unprecedented surge of infections. This study developed a mathematical model that optimizes diagnostic capacity with lab-based PCR testing. METHODS: A mathematical model was constructed to determine the value of PCR testing in relation to the pre-test probability of COVID-19. Furthermore, the model derives the lower and upper bounds for the threshold pre-test probability of the designated priority group. The model was applied in a German setting using the PCR test-positivity rate at the beginning of February 2022. RESULTS: The value function of PCR testing is bell-shaped with respect to the pre-test probability, reaching a maximum at a pre-test probability of 0.5. Based on a PCR test-positivity rate of 0.3 and assuming that at least two thirds of the tested population have a pre-test probability below, lower and higher pre-test probability thresholds are >/= 0.1 and 0.7, respectively. Therefore, individuals who have a 25% likelihood of testing positive because they exhibit symptoms should be a higher priority for PCR testing. Furthermore, a positive rapid antigen test in asymptomatic individuals with no known exposure to COVID-19 should be confirmed using PCR. Yet, symptomatic individuals with a positive RAT should be excluded from PCR testing.

METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal assessment of public interest in myocarditis, and its association with actual coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) -related myocarditis during the first wave of the pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-related myocarditis following vaccine rollout. To complete this objective, we used data from 3 sources: a report from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting database, and from Google Trends. RESULTS: Results show that Relative Search Interest (RSI) was low before and during the initial phase of the pandemic and peaked in April 2021, during the initial vaccine push.

METHODS: In the present study, we assessed the gut microbial composition in healthy adults, and performed comparison before and post an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, BBIBP-CorV vaccination. RESULTS: Microbial diversity in shannon, pielou evenness, simpson and invsimpson index was remarkably suppressed by vaccination. Ruminococcus and Actinomyces were observed to be strikingly deficient, and Faecalibacterium was dramatically augmented after BBIBP-CorV treatment. Potential functional profiles of gut microbiome in amino acid metabolism, lipid biosynthesis proteins and steroid biosynthesis were remarkably increased, while the capacity in renin-angiotensin system was remarkably decreased following vaccines.

METHODS: We administered the COVID-19 vaccine to the medical staff at Yamagata University Hospital from March to August 2021. Subsequently, we conducted an online questionnaire-based survey to investigate the presence of allergy and adverse reactions after vaccination and examine the association between allergy and adverse reactions after immunization. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 1586 to 1306 participants after the first and second administration of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. Adverse reactions included injection site pain, injection site swelling, fever, fatigue or malaise, headache, chills, nausea, muscle pain outside the injection site, and arthralgia. The frequency of some adverse reactions and their severity were higher, and the duration of symptoms was longer in participants with allergies than in those without allergies. Although several participants visited the emergency room for treatment after the first and second vaccinations, no participant was diagnosed with anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the frequency and severity of adverse reactions after injection of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were higher in individuals with allergy; however, no severe adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis or death were observed.

Nonetheless, since the beginning of the pandemic, it has been well-documented that older adults as well as people enduring an immunocompromised condition are the most likely to develop a severe COVID-19 form owing to a less robust immune system and therefore a weaker immunologic response to COVID-19 vaccination. Herein, we report an observational prospective monocentric study of a series made up of 30 patients fully vaccinated against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) out of a total of 139 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) for a critical form of COVID-19 between February 2021 and October 2021. This observational study was conducted during the peak of the pandemic outbreak and therefore its main aim was to describe the epidemiological and sociodemographic features of fully vaccinated patients who endured critical forms of COVID-19. Immunocompromised people as well as those with chronic underlying comorbidities are more likely to develop critical forms of COVID-19. Moreover, it seems that vaccine efficacy decreases gradually over time. SARS-CoV-2 variants may also undermine vaccine effectiveness.

Phylogenetic tree analysis of the proteomes of SARS-CoV-2 variants with Neighbor-Joining and Maximum Parsimony methods indicated that haplotype 2 variant with nsp12 P323L and Spike D614G was dominant (98.81%), including new sub-haplotypes 2A_1 to 2A_3, 2B_1 to 2B_3, and 2C_1 to 2C_2 emerged post-one-year COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, the profiling of sub-haplotypes indicated that sub-haplotype 2A_1 with the mutations at N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, and D118H in Spike was over 58% in May 2021 in the high partly vaccinated rate group (US, Canada, and Germany).

Sub-haplotypes 2A_1 and 2C_3 had a meaningful alternation of ACE2-specific recognition site, neutralization epitopes, and furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The results discovered the haplotype diversity and new sub-haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 variants post one-year pandemic in January-March 2021, showing the profiles of sub-haplotypes in the groups with low and high partly vaccinated rates in May 2021.

RESULTS: A total of 444 patients were included from the 2 study periods, and 416 patients (93.7%) had concordant results between ART and polymerase chain reaction. The overall sensitivity and specificity of ART were 83.3% (95% CI: 75.2-89.3) and 97.5% (95% CI: 95.0-98.8), respectively. Negative predictive values of ART between the Omicron emergence and Omicron peak periods for a probable case group were 71.4% and 66.7%, respectively, and for a suspect case group 91.4% and 75.0%, respectively. Negative predictive values for an unlikely case group was >95% in both periods. Positive predictive value of ART was >85% for probable and suspect case groups in both periods. Seventy-five percent of patients (n = 15) who were incorrectly classified as SARS-CoV-2 negative by ART had potentially viable virus. No large nosocomial transmission clusters were detected.

The ID NOW severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification near-patient test which targets the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene. AIM: To assess the diagnostic performance of ID NOW as a COVID-19 triage tool for medical admissions from the ED of a large acute hospital. METHODS: All adult acute medical admissions from the ED between 31(st) March and 31(st) July 2021 with valid ID NOW and RT-PCR results were included. The diagnostic accuracy of ID NOW [sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)] was calculated against the laboratory reference standard. Discrepant results were explored further using cycle threshold values and clinical data. FINDINGS: Two percent (124/6050) of medical admissions were SARS-CoV-2 positive on RT-PCR.

However, target testing levels and effectiveness of asymptomatic community screening to impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission in LMICs are unclear. METHODS: We used Propelling Action for Testing and Treating (PATAT), an LMIC-focused agent-based model to simulate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemics, varying the amount of Ag-RDTs available for symptomatic testing at healthcare facilities and asymptomatic community testing in different social settings. We assumed that testing was a function of access to healthcare facilities and availability of Ag-RDTs. We explicitly modelled symptomatic testing demand from individuals without SARS-CoV-2 and measured impact based on the number of infections averted due to test-and-isolate. RESULTS: Testing symptomatic individuals yields greater benefits than any asymptomatic community testing strategy until most symptomatic individuals who sought testing have been tested. Meeting symptomatic testing demand likely requires at least 200-400 tests/100 000 people/day, on average, as symptomatic testing demand is highly influenced by individuals without SARS-CoV-2. After symptomatic testing demand is satisfied, excess tests to proactively screen for asymptomatic infections among household members yield the largest additional infections averted. CONCLUSIONS: Testing strategies aimed at reducing transmission should prioritize symptomatic testing and incentivizing test-positive individuals to adhere to isolation to maximize effectiveness.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36208211/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/6754174 https://sci-hub.do/ciac814 https://sci-hub.do/10.1093/cid/ciac814", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States", "topic": 1, "prop": 1.0}, {"uid": 35065265, "aid": "S1198-743X(21)00727-8 10.1016/j.cmi.2021.12.019", "titl": "Prospective evaluation of the point-of-care use of a rapid antigenic SARS-CoV-2 immunochromatographic test in a paediatric emergency department.", "mesh": "*COVID-19/diagnosis;;; COVID-19 Testing;;; Child;;; Emergency Service, Hospital;;; Humans;;; Point-of-Care Systems;;; *SARS-CoV-2;;; Sensitivity and Specificity", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Ollier, Quentin; Pillet, Sylvie; Mory, Olivier; Gagnaire, Julie; Thuiller, Charlotte; Annino, Nadine; Gagneux-Brunon, Amandine; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Bourlet, Thomas; Pozzetto, Bruno; Cantais, Aymeric", "jour": "Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases", "affl": "Pediatric Emergency Department, University-Hospital of Saint Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.;;; Department of Infectious Agents and Hygiene, University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France; Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Team GIMAP, Universite Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon, Lyon, France.;;; Pediatric Emergency Department, University-Hospital of Saint Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.;;; Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Team GIMAP, Universite Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon, Lyon, France; Department of Infectious Diseases, University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.;;; Pediatric Emergency Department, University-Hospital of Saint Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.;;; Pediatric Emergency Department, University-Hospital of Saint Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.;;; Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Team GIMAP, Universite Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon, Lyon, France; Department of Infectious Diseases, University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.;;; Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Team GIMAP, Universite Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon, Lyon, France; Department of Infectious Diseases, University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.;;; Department of Infectious Agents and Hygiene, University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France; Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Team GIMAP, Universite Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon, Lyon, France.;;; Department of Infectious Agents and Hygiene, University-Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France; Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Team GIMAP, Universite Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon, Lyon, France.;;; Pediatric Emergency Department, University-Hospital of Saint Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France; Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Team GIMAP, Universite Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon, Lyon, France.

METHODS: The study included 24 hospitalized children after COVID-19 diagnosis, 23 pediatrics that received outpatient treatment, and 21 children who were without COVID-19 diagnosis as the control group between June 2021 and July 2021. Transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emission, and contrlateral suppression of otoacoustic emission measurements were carried out for each child. Symptoms of patients, the treatments they received, and the duration of hospitalization of the children in the hospitalized group were recorded. RESULTS: The comparison of TEOAE test results under masking showed a considerable difference between 3 groups at 1 kHz (p=0.033) and 4 kHz (p=0.021) frequencies (p<0.05). Distortion product otoacoustic emission test results of hospitalized outpatient and control group showed a statistically significant difference at 2 kHz among themselves (p=0.009).
