Background Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy is established as the standard surgical approach for the treatment of <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">benign<sub>0.55</sub></span><span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">benign ovarian cysts<sub>1.0</sub></span>. However, previous studies have shown that potential fertility can be directly impaired by laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">diminished<sub>0.97</sub></span> ovarian reserve (DOR), and even <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">premature ovarian failure<sub>1.0</sub></span>. Therefore, fertility-preserving interventions are required for <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">benign gynecologic diseases<sub>1.0</sub></span>. However, there are still little data on the time period required for recovery of ovarian reserve after the laparoscopic unilateral ovarian cystectomy, which is very important for the individualization of treatment protocols. This study aimed at investigating the time needed for the ovarian reserve to recover after laparoscopic unilateral ovarian non-endometriotic cystectomy.   Materials and Methods Sixty-seven <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">patients<sub>0.98</sub></span> with <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">unilateral ovarian non-endometriotic cyst<sub>0.96</sub></span> from Zhoupu and Punan Hospitals who underwent laparoscopic unilateral ovarian cystectomy were recruited as a postoperative observation group (POG).

A postoperative 6-month follow-up of cases was performed.   Results Compared with RFG, AFC of cyst side in the POG group showed no difference in the first, third, and sixth postoperative month (F = 0.03, F = 0.02, F = 0.55, respectively; p = 0.873, p = 0.878, p = 0.460, respectively). The OARI of cyst side in the <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">POG<sub>1.0</sub></span> group revealed no differences in the first, third, and sixth postoperative month (F = 0.73, F = 3.57, F = 1.75, respectively; p = 0.395, p = 0.061, p = 0.701, respectively). In the first month, the postoperative <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> levels significantly declined, reaching 1.88 ng/ml [interquartile range (IQR): 1.61-2.16 ng/ml] in POG and 2.57 ng/ml (IQR: 2.32-2.83 ng/ml) in RFG (F = 13.43, p = 0.000).

Couples were randomly assigned (1:1) with an online system to receive either PICSI or a standard ICSI procedure. The primary outcome was full-term (37 weeks' gestational age) livebirth, which was assessed in all eligible couples who completed follow-up. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN99214271.

METHODS This study was a cohort study in which a total of 9431 <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.96</sub></span> aged 20-51years who were undergoing their first IVF cycles were recruited. Ovarian response parameters included the number of retrieved <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">oocytes<sub>0.58</sub></span>, the number of 2 pronuclear zygotes (2PN), and the frequency of good-quality embryos (GQE). Pregnancy outcomes included the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), live birth rate (LBR), miscarriage rate (MR), and cumulative CPR and LBR (CCPR and CLBR).   RESULTS Among <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.94</sub></span> under 35years of age, the ovarian response, CPR, CCPR, LBR and CLBR (p<0.01) were significantly lower in the low-<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.98</sub></span> group than in the average-<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.97</sub></span> and high-<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.98</sub></span> groups. In <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.95</sub></span> above 35years of age, the ovarian response, CPR, CCPR and CLBR (p<0.01) were significantly higher in the average-<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.94</sub></span> and low-<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.94</sub></span> groups. The LBR in the older high-<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.92</sub></span> group was significantly higher (37.45% vs 20.34%, p<0.01) than that in the older low-<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.88</sub></span> group, but there was no difference (37.45% vs 32.46%, p=0.11) compared with the older average-AMH group. When there was a discrepancy between age and the <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> level, the young low-<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> group showed a poorer ovarian response but a better CPR (58.01% vs 49.44%, p<0.01) and LBR (48.52% vs 37.45%, p<0.01) than the older high-<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.69</sub></span> group. However, the CCPR (65.37% vs 66.11%, p=0.75) and CLBR (56.35% vs 52.89%, p=0.15) between the two groups were comparable. The conservative CLBR in the two discrepancy groups increased until the third embryo transfer and reached a plateau thereafter.   CONCLUSION(S) Even with a relatively low AMH level, young <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.95</sub></span> still had better pregnancy outcomes following IVF than older <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.96</sub></span>.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Low ovarian reserve, as indicated by <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.61</sub></span> or AFC, is not associated with <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">miscarriage<sub>0.84</sub></span> in young <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.87</sub></span> conceiving with ART. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Presently, the impact of low ovarian reserve on the risk of miscarriage remains controversial. Some studies have reported an association between <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">serum AMH<sub>0.87</sub></span> levels and <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">AFC<sub>0.97</sub></span> and <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">miscarriage<sub>0.91</sub></span>, but others have failed to confirm these findings. The main limitation that undermines the reliability and consistency of the results is the confounding effect of female age. Indeed, after 35years of age, on the one hand, the risk of <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">miscarriage<sub>0.75</sub></span> starts increasing because of impaired <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">oocyte<sub>0.66</sub></span> quality while, on the other, the physiological decline in <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> and <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AFC<sub>0.97</sub></span> levels continues, thus hampering the possibility to properly explore the real effects of reduced ovarian reserve. Indeed, the two processes, i.e. the gradual loss of resting primordial follicles and the loss of <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">oocyte<sub>0.65</sub></span> quality, progress in parallel. In other words, the older the <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">woman<sub>0.94</sub></span> becomes, the higher is the risk of miscarriage, but one cannot distinguish between the effects of biological aging on <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">oocyte<sub>0.73</sub></span> quality and those mediated by a lower ovarian reserve. STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: The present retrospective monocentric cohort study was carried out at Fondazione IRCSS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan. All <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.92</sub></span> referred to the ART Unit between 2014 and 2021 and who underwent either conventional IVF (c-IVF), ICSI, or IUI were reviewed. Only <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.95</sub></span> younger than 35 were eligible because, up to this age, the risk of miscarriage is steady and not strictly related to age. <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">PARTICIPANTS<sub>0.92</sub></span>/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">Women<sub>0.92</sub></span> younger than 35 who achieved a singleton clinical pregnancy with c-IVF, ICSI, or IUI were selected. <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">Women<sub>0.86</sub></span> with patent causes of recurrent <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">miscarriage<sub>0.99</sub></span> were excluded, as well as those undergoing pregnancy termination for fetal or medical causes. <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">Women<sub>0.93</sub></span> who did and did not have a pregnancy loss before 20 weeks&#x27; gestation were compared. Detailed information was obtained from charts of the consulting <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">patients<sub>0.99</sub></span>. ART procedures were performed according to the standardized policy of our Unit. All <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.88</sub></span> underwent <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">serum AMH<sub>0.93</sub></span> measurement and a transvaginal assessment of AFC prior to initiation of treatment. <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> levels were measured by a commercially available ELISA assay. To assess AFC, all identifiable <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">antral follicles<sub>0.75</sub></span> 2-10mm in diameter at ultrasound were recorded. The primary outcome was the risk of miscarriage for <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.93</sub></span> with <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">serum AMH<sub>0.92</sub></span> levels below 5pmol/l. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There were 538 <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.94</sub></span> were included, of whom 92 (17%) had a miscarriage. The areas under the ROC curves for prediction of miscarriage based on <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> levels and AFC were 0.51 (95% CI: 0.45-0.58) and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.45-0.59), respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of miscarriage for <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.95</sub></span> with <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">serum AMH<sub>0.98</sub></span> levels below 5.0pmol/l was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.51-2.36); the adjusted OR was 1.12 (95% CI: 0.51-2.45). Analyses were repeated considering other thresholds for <span style=\"color: #ECC58B\">AMH<sub>0.57</sub></span> (2.9, 3.6 and 7.9pmol/l) and for AFC (thresholds of 7 and 10). No associations emerged. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: The retrospective design of the study hampered the collection of more precise but potentially relevant clinical information of the couples. We did not exclude <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.91</sub></span> suffering from <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">PCOS<sub>1.0</sub></span>, a condition possibly associated with miscarriage. Moreover, the baseline characteristics of <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.93</sub></span> who did and did not have a miscarriage differed in some characteristics. Thus, we adjusted the OR using a multivariate analysis, but we cannot fully exclude residual confounding effects. Finally, our results cannot be inferred to <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.96</sub></span> older than 35. The mechanisms causing premature exhaustion of ovarian reserve may be different in younger and older <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.92</sub></span> and this may lead to a different impact on the risk of miscarriage.

BACKGROUND <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">Anti-Mllerian hormone<sub>1.0</sub></span> (<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.98</sub></span>) is a member of the <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">TGF family<sub>0.99</sub></span> of growth and differentiation factors with a key role in regulating folliculogenesis. In experimental studies, using supraphysiologic concentrations, <span style=\"color: #ECC58B\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> inhibits <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">breast cancer<sub>1.0</sub></span> growth. However, high levels of <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.94</sub></span> were associated with increased <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">breast cancer<sub>0.99</sub></span> risk in two prior prospective epidemiologic studies.

BACKGROUND: For <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.9</sub></span> of advanced maternal age or couples with high risk of genetic mutations, the ability to screen for <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">embryos<sub>0.47</sub></span> free of certain <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">genetic<sub>0.66</sub></span> mutations is reassuring, as it provides opportunity to address age-related decline in fertility through preimplantation genetic testing. This procedure has potential to facilitate better embryo selection, improve implantation rates with single embryo transfer and reduce miscarriage rates, among others, yet confers some risk to the embryo and additional costs of assisted reproductive technology. This raises questions whether, when and which <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">patients<sub>0.98</sub></span> should receive routine PGT-A prior to embryo transfer. DISCUSSION: Prenatal diagnostic procedures refer to tests done when one or both genetic parents has a known <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">genetic disorder<sub>1.0</sub></span> (or has worries about the disorder) and testing is performed on them, their <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">gametes<sub>0.69</sub></span> or on the <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">embryos<sub>0.53</sub></span> to determine if the latter is likely to carry a <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">genetic disorder<sub>1.0</sub></span>. PGT is used to identify <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">genetic defects<sub>1.0</sub></span> in <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">gametes<sub>0.79</sub></span> or <span style=\"color: #C6DEF5\">embryos<sub>0.69</sub></span> (often created through in vitro fertilization (IVF). The procedures generate immense potential to improve health and wellbeing by preventing conception or birth of babies with undesirable traits, life-limiting conditions and even lethal conditions. However, they generate a lot of information, which often may challenge decision-making ability of healthcare providers and parents, and raise ethical challenges. CONCLUSION: Prenatal diagnostic procedures have potential to address uncertainty and risk of having a <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">child<sub>0.64</sub></span> affected with a <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">genetic disease<sub>1.0</sub></span>. They, however, often raise own uncertainty and controversies, whose origin, manifestation and related ethical issues are presented.

The diagnosis of <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">anovulatory disorders<sub>1.0</sub></span> that may have long-term health consequences is too often delayed.   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A review of the literature in English was conducted, and data were summarized and integrated from the author's perspective.   MAIN FINDINGS Normal <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">adolescent anovulation<sub>0.72</sub></span> causes only minor menstrual cycle irregularity: most cycles range from 21-45 days, even in the first postmenarcheal year, 90% by the fourth year. Approximately half of symptomatic <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">menstrual irregularity<sub>1.0</sub></span> is due to <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">neuroendocrine immaturity<sub>1.0</sub></span>, and half is associated with increased <span style=\"color: #ECC58B\">androgen<sub>1.0</sub></span> levels. The former is manifest as aluteal or short/deficient luteal phase cycles and usually resolves spontaneously. The latter seems related to <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">polycystic ovary syndrome<sub>1.0</sub></span> because adolescent <span style=\"color: #ECC58B\">androgen<sub>1.0</sub></span> levels are associated with adult <span style=\"color: #ECC58B\">androgens<sub>1.0</sub></span> and <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">ovulatory dysfunction<sub>1.0</sub></span>, but data are sparse. <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">Obesity<sub>1.0</sub></span> causes <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">hyperandrogenemia<sub>1.0</sub></span> and, via unclear mechanisms, seems to suppress <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">LH<sub>nan</sub></span>; it may mimic <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">polycystic ovary syndrome<sub>1.0</sub></span>.

High-sensitivity <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">gonadotropin<sub>1.0</sub></span> and <span style=\"color: #ECC58B\">steroid<sub>0.99</sub></span> assays, the latter by specialty laboratories, are necessary for accurate diagnosis of <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">pubertal disorders<sub>1.0</sub></span>. <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">Polycystic ovaries<sub>1.0</sub></span> are a normal ultrasonographic finding in young <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.83</sub></span> and are associated with nearly 2-fold increased <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">anti-Mllerian hormone<sub>1.0</sub></span> levels. Oral contraceptives are generally the first-line treatment for ongoing <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">menstrual dysfunction<sub>1.0</sub></span>, and the effects of treatment are similar among preparations.

This study demonstrates an association of baseline <span style=\"color: #ECC58B\">dehydroepinadrostendione sulphate<sub>1.0</sub></span> (<span style=\"color: #ECC58B\">DHEAS<sub>1.0</sub></span>) concentration with implantation rate and live birth rate after the first <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">gonadotrophin-releasing hormone<sub>1.0</sub></span> antagonist IVF cycle in young <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.86</sub></span> who are expected to respond poorly to ovarian stimulation.

DESIGN/METHODS In 279 young <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.93</sub></span> of the PROGRAM/PREMS study, aged 18-24 years, the influence of gestational age, birth length and birth weight on serum levels of <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">anti-Mllerian hormone<sub>1.0</sub></span> (AMH) was analysed with multiple regression modelling. Additionally, <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> levels were analysed in preterm- versus term-born females and in three subgroups: females born <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">SGA<sub>1.0</sub></span> with either <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">short stature<sub>1.0</sub></span> or catch-up growth (SGA-CU), and females born term and appropriate for gestational age with normal stature (AGA controls).   RESULTS Preterm and <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">SGA<sub>0.9</sub></span> birth did not affect <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.97</sub></span> and other hormone levels. Older age at menarche and oral contraceptive pill use (OC-use) were related to lower <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> levels, and maternal smoking during gestation was related to higher <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.98</sub></span> levels. After correction for maternal smoking, lower socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with lower <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> levels. In subgroup comparisons, SGA-CU <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.98</sub></span> showed higher <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> levels than AGA controls, also after adjustment for several factors.   CONCLUSION Preterm and SGA birth did not affect <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.99</sub></span> levels. Factors associated with <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">serum AMH<sub>0.97</sub></span> levels were OC-use, age at menarche, maternal smoking during gestation and SES.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether opportunistic salpingectomy in premenopausal <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.94</sub></span> undergoing hysterectomy for benign indications is both hormonally and surgically safe, compared with hysterectomy without salpingectomy.   STUDY DESIGN In this multicentre randomised controlled trial, <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.93</sub></span> were randomised to undergo either hysterectomy with opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy (intervention group) or standard hysterectomy with preservation of the Fallopian tubes (control group).   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the difference in <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">serum anti-Mllerian hormone<sub>0.83</sub></span> concentration (<span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.98</sub></span>), measured pre-surgery and 6 months post-surgery. Secondary outcomes were surgical outcomes and duration of hospital stay. The sample size was powered at 50 <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">participants<sub>0.97</sub></span> per group (n=100) to compare <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">AMH<sub>0.92</sub></span> after hysterectomy with salpingectomy to <span style=\"color: #fdbbbb\">AMH<sub>0.84</sub></span> after standard hysterectomy.   RESULTS Between March 2013 and December 2016, 104 <span style=\"color: #A6EFDC\">women<sub>0.95</sub></span>, aged 30-55 years, were randomly allocated to hysterectomy with opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy (n=52) or standard hysterectomy (n=52). The baseline characteristics did not differ between the two groups. The median <span style=\"color: #E2DB8C\">AMH<sub>0.95</sub></span> was -0.14pmol/L (IQR -1.47-0.95) in the intervention group and 0.00pmol/L (IQR -1.05-0.80) in the control group (p=0.49). The addition of salpingectomy did not impair surgical results and it did not affect duration of hospital stay.   CONCLUSION Addition of opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy during hysterectomy did not result in a larger effect on ovarian reserve when compared with hysterectomy alone, neither did it affect surgical outcomes.
