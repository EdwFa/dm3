NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in the Western world. NAFLD is closely associated with metabolic disorders, including central obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and persistent abnormalities of liver function tests.In general NAFLD is a common denominer for a broad spectrum of damage to the liver, which can be due to hepatocyte injury, inflammatory processes and fibrosis. This is normally seen on liver biopsy and can range from milder forms (steatosis) to the more severe forms (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver failure). In these patients, advanced fibrosis is the major predictor of morbidity and liver-related mortality, and an accurate diagnosis of NASH and NAFLD is mandatory. Histologic evaluation with liver biopsy remains the gold standard to diagnose NAFLD. Diagnosis of NAFLD is defined as presence of hepatic steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Weight loss, dietary modification, and the treatment of underlying metabolic syndrome remain the mainstays of therapy once the diagnosis is established. Dietary recommendations and lifestyle interventions, weight loss, and the treatment of underlying metabolic syndrome remain the mainstays of therapy once the diagnosis is established with promising results but are difficult to maintain.

Despite affecting an estimated 1 in 4 adults globally, NAFLD is largely absent on national and global health agendas. METHODS: We collected data from 102 countries, accounting for 86% of the world population, on NAFLD policies, guidelines, civil society engagement, clinical management, and epidemiologic data. A preparedness index was developed by coding questions into 6 domains (policies, guidelines, civil awareness, epidemiology and data, NAFLD detection, and NAFLD care management) and categorising the responses as high, medium, and low; a multiple correspondence analysis was then applied. RESULTS: The highest scoring countries were India (42.7) and the United Kingdom (40.0), with 32 countries (31%) scoring zero out of 100. For 5 of the domains a minority of countries were categorised as high-level while the majority were categorised as low-level. No country had a national or sub-national strategy for NAFLD and <2% of the different strategies for related conditions included any mention of NAFLD. National NAFLD clinical guidelines were present in only 32 countries. CONCLUSIONS: Although NAFLD is a pressing public health problem, no country was found to be well prepared to address it. There is a pressing need for strategies to address NAFLD at national and global levels. LAY SUMMARY: Around a third of the countries scored a zero on the NAFLD policy preparedness index, with no country scoring over 50/100.

NAFLD is rapidly becoming a global health challenge, and there is a need for improved diagnostic- and prognostic tools and for effective pharmacotherapies to treat NASH. The molecular mechanisms of NAFLD development and progression remain incompletely understood, though ample evidence supports a role of microRNAs (miRNAs) - small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression - in the progression of metabolic liver disease. SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this review, we summarise the currently available liver miRNA profiling studies in people with various stages of NAFLD. We further describe the mechanistic role of three of the most extensively studied miRNA species, miR-34a, miR-122 and miR-21, and highlight selected findings on novel NAFLD-linked miRNAs. We also examine the literature on exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) as inter-hepatocellular or -organ messengers in NAFLD. Furthermore, we address the status for utilizing circulating NAFLD-associated miRNAs as minimally invasive tools for disease diagnosis, staging and prognosis as well as their potential use as NASH pharmacotherapeutic targets. Finally, we reflect on future directions for research in the miRNA field. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD is associated with changes in hepatic miRNA expression patterns at early, intermediate and late stages, and specific miRNA species appear to be involved in steatosis development and NAFL progression to NASH and cirrhosis. These miRNAs act either within or between hepatocytes and other liver cell types such as hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells or as circulating inter-organ messengers carrying signals between the liver and extra-hepatic metabolic tissues, including the adipose tissues and the cardiovascular system. Among circulating miRNAs linked to NAFLD, miR-34a, miR-122 and miR-192 are the best candidates as biomarkers for NAFLD diagnosis and staging. To date, no miRNA-targeting pharmacotherapy has been approved for the treatment of NASH, and no such therapy is currently under clinical development.

METHODS: We performed a randomized and controlled clinical trial. Patients in the non-FMT group were administered oral probiotics. In the FMT group, patients were randomized to receive FMT with donor stool (heterologous) via colonoscopy, followed by three enemas over 3 days. Both groups were also required to maintain a healthy diet and keep regular exercise for more than 40 min every day. They returned to the hospital for reexamination 1 month after treatment. RESULTS: FMT can decrease the fat accumulation in the liver by improving the gut microbiota dysbiosis, thus attenuating fatty liver disease. Significant differences in the clinical features and gut microbiota between lean and obese NAFLD patients were unveiled.

Remarkably, while sarcopenia and NAFLD-related fibrosis are independently associated with all-cause mortality, the combination of both conditions entails a greater risk for all-cause and cardiac-specific mortality. Interestingly, both sarcopenia and NAFLD-related fibrosis share common pathophysiological pathways, including insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, hyperammonemia, alterations in the regulation of myokines, sex hormones and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling, which may explain reciprocal connections between these two disorders. Additional contributing factors, such as the gut microbiome, may also play a role in this relationship. In skeletal muscle, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and myostatin signaling are the central anabolic and catabolic pathways, respectively, and the imbalance between them can lead to muscle wasting in patients with NAFLD-related fibrosis.

Some of the current and emerging pharmacological options for NAFLD have shown possible anti-osteoporotic properties (eg, vitamin E, obeticholic acid, semaglutide), while others (eg, pioglitazone, canagliflozin) have been associated with increased risk of fractures and may be avoided in patients with NAFLD and concomitant osteoporosis, especially those at high fracture risk. Conversely, some anti-osteoporotic medications (denosumab) might benefit NAFLD, while others (raloxifene) might adversely affect it and, consequently, may be avoided in patients with osteoporosis and NAFLD.

METHODS: Participants free of IBS, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, alcoholic liver disease, and any cancer at baseline from the UK Biobank were included. Non-alcoholic fatty liver degree was measured by a well-validated fatty liver index (FLI), with FLI >/= 60 as an indicator of NAFLD. Primary outcome was incident IBS. Cox proportional hazard model was used to investigate the associated risk of incident IBS. RESULTS: Among 396,838 participants (mean FLI was 48.29 +/- 30.07), 153,203(38.6%) were with NAFLD diagnosis at baseline. During a median of 12.4-year follow-up, 7129 cases of incident IBS were identified. Compared with non-NAFLD, NAFLD patients showed a 13% higher risk of developing IBS (HR = 1.13, 95%CI: 1.05-1.17) after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the lowest, the highest FLI quartile was associated with a significantly increased risk of IBS (HR(Q4 VS Q1) = 1.21, 1.13-1.30, P(trend) < 0.001).

METHODS: In this systematic review, we searched Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library from January 1, 1950 through July 30, 2020. We included studies reporting on HCC incidence in patients with NAFLD. The main outcomes were pooled HCC incidences in patients with NAFLD at distinct severity stages. Summary estimates were calculated with random-effects models. Sensitivity analyses and meta-regression analyses were carried out to address heterogeneity. RESULTS: We included 18 studies involving 470,404 patients. In patients with NAFLD at a stage earlier than cirrhosis, the incidence rate of HCC was 0.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.07; I(2) = 98%).

METHODS: We included 8397 individuals without previous liver condition or excess alcohol intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004. NAFLD was diagnosed with Fatty Liver Index (FLI) >/= 60 or USFLI >/= 30, and participants with advanced fibrosis risks were identified with elevated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/platelet ratio index (APRI). Step-wide logistic regression adjusting for confounders was used to detect the association between NAFLD or advanced fibrosis with serum vitamin B12, folate, red blood cell folate (RBC folate), homocysteine (HCY), and methylmalonic acid (MMA). RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of NAFLD was 44.2%. Compared with non-NAFLD participants, patients with NAFLD showed significantly increased RBC folate level and RBC counts, decreased serum vitamin B12 and folate, and similar HCY and MMA levels. NAFLD with advanced fibrosis risk had higher MMA and HCY, reduced serum vitamin B12, and similar serum folate and RBC folate levels than NAFLD with low fibrosis risk. Only RBC folate was independently associated with an increased risk of NAFLD (OR (95% CI): 2.24 (1.58, 3.18)). In all participants, MMA (OR: 1.41 (1.10, 1.80)) and HCY (OR: 2.76 (1.49, 5.11)) were independently associated with increased risk for advanced fibrosis. In participants with NAFLD, this independent association still existed (OR: 1.39 (1.04, 1.85) for MMA and 1.95 (1.09, 3.46) for HCY). In all participants, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) on fibrosis was 0.6829 (0.6828, 0.6831) for MMA and 0.7319 (0.7318, 0.7320) for HCY; in participants with NAFLD, the corresponding ROC AUC was 0.6819 (0.6817, 0.6821) for MMA and 0.6926 (0.6925, 0.6928) for HCY. CONCLUSION: Among vitamin B12-associated biomarkers, RBC folate was independently associated with elevated NAFLD risk, whereas MMA and HCY were associated with increased risk for advanced fibrosis in the total population and NAFLD participants.

Observed associations in these epidemiological studies fail to show sequential temporality and suffer from problems of confounding. Therefore, we performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the relationship between serum iron status and NAFLD. Methods: The inverse weighted method (IVW) meta-analysis with the fixed-effect model was the main method to estimate the relationship between iron status, including serum ferritin, iron, transferrin saturation (TSAT) and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and NAFLD. Weighted median, penalized weighted median, and MR Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR RAPS) methods were used as additional analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed with Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger regression, Steiger filtering, and the MR PRESSO test. Results: Iron status, including serum ferritin, iron, and TSAT, was associated with an increased risk of NAFLD (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.25 (1.06, 1.48); 1.24 (1.05, 1.46), 1.16 (1.02, 1.31), respectively).

Conclusions: Our findings corroborated the causal associations between serum ferritin, iron, TSAT, and NAFLD, which might suggest the potential benefits of iron-related therapy.

The correlation between gut microbiota and metabolic disorder has been widely recognized. Metabolic disorder could cause imbalance in gut microbiota, and disturbance of gut microbiota could aggravate metabolic disorder as well. Berberine (BBR), as a natural ingredient, plays an important role in the treatment of metabolic disorder. Studies have shown that BBR can alleviate the pathological conditions of metabolic disorders, and the mechanism is related to the regulation of gut microbiota: gut microbiota could regulate the absorption and utilization of berberine in the body; meanwhile, the structure and function of gut microbiota also changed after intervention by berberine. Therefore, we summarize relevant mechanism research, including the expressions of nitroreductases-producing bacteria to promote the absorption and utilization of berberine, strengthening intestinal barrier function, ameliorating inflammation regulating bile acid signal pathway and axis of bacteria-gut-brain.

We aimed to estimate the absolute incidence rates of these cancers in adults with NAFLD with respect to key demographic and clinical factors. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases for studies reporting the incidence rates of any cancer in adults with NAFLD from inception to 31 August 2020. The main meta-analysis outcomes were pooled incidences of cancers in NAFLD using random-effects modelling. Subgroup analyses examined the effects of NAFLD disease stage. FINDINGS: In total, 64 studies were eligible for analysis of HCC and extrahepatic cancer incidence including 625,984 and 41,027 patients, respectively. The pooled HCC incidence rate was 1.25 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 1.01 to 1.49; I(2) = 94.8%). In patients with NAFLD with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, the HCC incidence rate was 14.46 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 10.89 to 18.04; I(2) = 91.3%). The pooled extrahepatic cancer incidence rate was 10.58 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 8.14 to 13.02; I(2) = 97.1%). The most frequently occurring extrahepatic cancers were uterine, breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung. Extrahepatic cancer incidence rates were not higher in patients with NAFLD with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. INTERPRETATION: The rate of HCC development in patients with NAFLD who have progressed to advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis supports current HCC surveillance recommendations targeted for this group. Extrahepatic cancers are over eight-fold more frequent than HCC in NAFLD and not associated with liver fibrosis stage.

In this review, we provide an overview of the interrelation of these processes, the link between systemic and local inflammation and the role of dysfunctional adipose tissue (AT) in the NAFLD development. Multiple extrahepatic triggers of the pathophysiological mechanisms of NAFLD are described: nutritional deficiency or malnutrition, unhealthy food intake, the dysfunction of the liver-gut axis, the involvement of the mesenteric adipose tissue, the role of adipokines such as adiponectin, of food intake hormone, the leptin and leptin resistance (LR) and adipose tissue's hormone, the resistin. In addition, a wide range of intrahepatic players are involved: oxidative stress, fatty acid oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, resident macrophages (Kupffer cells), neutrophils, dendritic cells (DCs), B and T lymphocytes contributing to the potential evolution of NAFLD to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This interdependent approach to complex dysmetabolic imbalance in NAFLD, integrating relevant studies, could contribute to a better clarification of pathogenesis and consequently the development of new personalized treatments, targeting de novo lipogenesis, chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

Our primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ezetimibe plus rosuvastatin versus rosuvastatin monotherapy to reduce liver fat using magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: A randomized controlled, open-label trial of 70 participants with NAFLD confirmed by ultrasound who were assigned to receive either ezetimibe 10 mg plus rosuvastatin 5 mg daily or rosuvastatin 5 mg for up to 24 weeks. The liver fat change was measured as average values in each of nine liver segments by MRI-PDFF. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) was used to measure liver fibrosis change. RESULTS: Combination therapy significantly reduced liver fat compared with monotherapy by MRI-PDFF (mean difference: 3.2%; p = 0.020). There were significant reductions from baseline to study completion by MRI-PDFF for both the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively (18.1 to 12.3%; p < 0.001 and 15.0 to 12.4%; p = 0.003). Individuals with higher body mass index, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and severe liver fibrosis were likely to be good responders to treatment with ezetimibe. MRE-derived change in liver fibrosis was not significantly different (both groups, p > 0.05). Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) by transient elastography was significantly reduced in the combination group (321 to 287 dB/m; p = 0.018), but not in the monotherapy group (323 to 311 dB/m; p = 0.104). CONCLUSIONS: Ezetimibe and rosuvastatin were found to be safe to treat participants with NAFLD. Furthermore, ezetimibe combined with rosuvastatin significantly reduced liver fat in this population.

Surrogate biomarkers of NAFLD were also calculated and followed over time. RESULTS: A significant decrease in anthropometric and glucometabolic parameters, insulin resistance, liver enzymes, and laboratory indices of hepatic steatosis was observed during treatment. Similarly, fat mass and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) decreased over time more than skeletal muscle and free-fat mass.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that individuals with NAFLD or elevated liver fat content have higher risk of psoriasis and that NAFLD is a causal risk factor for psoriasis. We tested this using a Mendelian randomization approach. METHODS: We included 108,835 individuals from the Danish general population, including 1,277 individuals with psoriasis and 802 individuals with NAFLD according to ICD codes. To estimate liver fat content, a subset of the participants (N = 7,416) also had a CT scan performed. First, we tested whether a diagnosis of NAFLD or elevated liver fat content was observationally associated with risk of psoriasis. Subsequently, we used the genetic variants PNPLA3 and TM6SF2, both strongly associated with NAFLD and high liver fat content, to test whether NAFLD was causally associated with increased risk of psoriasis. RESULTS: Observationally, individuals with vs. without a diagnosis of NAFLD had higher risk of psoriasis with an odds ratio of 2.03 (95% confidence interval 1.28-3.21). The risk of psoriasis increased in a stepwise manner with increasing liver fat content with an odds ratio of 5.00 (2.63-9.46) in individuals in the highest quartile of liver fat content compared to individuals in the lowest quartile. In genetic analyses, PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 were both associated with increased risk of NAFLD but not with increased risk of psoriasis. CONCLUSION: Observationally, a diagnosis of NAFLD or elevated liver fat content was associated with higher risk of psoriasis.

The most significant clinical and lifestyle variables observed by the predictive modeling were age (59 years [54.00-63.00 years]), hypertension (145 mm Hg [134.0-156.0 mm Hg] and 85 mm Hg [79.00-93.00 mm Hg]), waist circumference (98 cm [95.00-105.00 cm]), and sedentary lifestyle, defined as time spent watching TV >4 h/d. In the genetic data, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in IL16 and ANKLE1 gene were most significant. Our proposed ensemble-based integrative machine learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.849 using the random forest modeling for CVD prediction. Conclusions We propose a machine learning algorithm that identifies CVD in patients with NAFLD through integration of significant clinical, lifestyle, and genetic risk factors. These patients with NAFLD at higher risk of CVD should be flagged for screening and aggressive treatment of their cardiometabolic risk factors to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927450/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/JAH37009 https://sci-hub.do/10.1161/JAHA.121.022576", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 35483638, "aid": "S0168-3659(22)00230-9 10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.04.034", "titl": "Celastrol-loaded lactosylated albumin nanoparticles attenuate hepatic steatosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.", "mesh": "Animals;;; Diet, High-Fat;;; Lipid Metabolism;;; Lipids/therapeutic use;;; Liver/metabolism;;; Mice;;; Mice, Inbred C57BL;;; *Nanoparticles/chemistry;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/drug therapy/metabolism;;; Pentacyclic Triterpenes;;; RNA, Messenger/metabolism", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Fan, Ni; Zhao, Jia; Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Xiuying; Song, Qingchun; Shen, Yanting; Shum, Ho Cheung; Wang, Yu; Rong, Jianhui", "jour": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "affl": "School of Chinese Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; School of Chinese Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; School of Chinese Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; School of Chinese Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.;;; School of Chinese Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation, The University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China.

The present study was designed for developing biodegradable albumin-based nanoparticles to deliver CEL to the liver for treating NAFLD. CEL was entrapped into lactosylated bovine serum albumin (Lac-BSA) by high pressure homogenization to generate CEL-loaded Lac-BSA nanoparticles (CEL-Lac-BSA). CEL-Lac-BSA displayed spherical morphology, narrow size distribution at 158.6 +/- 3.4 nm and reasonable drug-loading efficiency at 13.62 +/- 0.13%. CEL-Lac-BSA not only showed better hepatocyte uptake and hepatic deposition than free CEL, but also outperformed in reducing lipid deposition, ameliorating liver function and enhancing insulin sensitivity in a mouse model of diet-induced NAFLD. Mechanistic studies indicated that CEL-Lac-BSA more effectively downregulated the mRNA levels of genes for lipogenesis and lipid transporter while upregulated the mRNA levels of lipolysis mediators. Western blot analysis confirmed the outperformance of CEL-Lac-BSA in enhancing the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and silent information regulation 2 homolog (SIRT1) and the protein levels of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) in NAFLD mice. Taken together, CEL-Lac-BSA showed better potential in the treatment of diet-induced NAFLD.

A candidate gene MAP3K4 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry staining in NAFLD and controls. RNA interference and immunoblotting were used to verify the roles of MAP3K4 in the formation of hepatic LDs. RESULTS: A total of 134 candidate genes were screened, including 44 up-regulated genes and 90 down-regulated genes. 29 genes in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) were selected as hub genes, including MAP3K4. The expression levels of MAP3K4 were positively correlated with NAFLD activity score (r = 0.702, p = 0.002). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation of MAP3K4 expression with serum total cholesterol (r = 0.564, p = 0.023), uric acid levels (r = 0.520, p = 0.039), and body mass index (r = 0.574, p = 0.020). Downregulation of MAP3K4 decreased LDs accumulation in HepG2 cells and reduced the expression of CGI-58 and Plin-2 by imbibition of JNK and group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activation.

We aimed to examine the risk and time to progression to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and death in a contemporary population over a long follow-up period, to obtain information to guide endpoint selection and sample size calculations for clinical trials on NAFLD-related cirrhosis. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data in a medical record linkage system, including all adults diagnosed with NAFLD between 1996-2016 by clinical, biochemical and radiological criteria in Olmsted County, Minnesota and followed until 2019. Liver-related outcomes and death were ascertained and validated by individual medical record review. Time and risk of progression from NAFLD to cirrhosis to decompensation and death were assessed using multistate modeling. RESULTS: A total of 5,123 individuals with NAFLD (median age 52 years, 53% women) were followed for a median of 6.4 (range 1-23) years. The risk of progression was as follows: from NAFLD to cirrhosis: 3% in 15 years; compensated cirrhosis to first decompensation: 33% in 4 years (8%/year); first decompensation to >/=2 decompensations: 48% in 2 years. Albumin, bilirubin, non-bleeding esophageal varices and diabetes were independent predictors of decompensation. Among the 575 deaths, 6% were liver related. Therapeutic trials in compensated cirrhosis would require enrolment of a minimum of 2,886 individuals followed for >2 years to detect at least a 15% relative decrease in liver-related endpoints. CONCLUSION: In this population-based cohort with 23 years of longitudinal follow-up, NAFLD was slowly progressive, with liver-related outcomes affecting only a small proportion of people. Large sample sizes and long follow-up are required to detect reductions in liver-related endpoints in clinical trials. LAY SUMMARY: For patients with compensated non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related cirrhosis, the time spent in this state and the risk of progression to decompensation are not well-known in the population. We examined the clinical course of a large population-based cohort over 23 years of follow-up. We identified that adults with compensated cirrhosis spend a mean time of 4 years in this state and have a 10% per year risk of progression to decompensation or death. The risk of further progression is 3-fold higher in adults with cirrhosis and one decompensating event.

AIMS: To review the existing literature on the epidemiology of HSD17B13 and discuss its role in the natural history, disease pathogenesis and treatment of NAFLD. METHODS: We extensively searched relevant literature in PubMed, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov and the reference list of articles included in the review. RESULTS: HSD17B13 is a liver-specific, lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein that has enzymatic pathways involving steroids, pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and retinol. The estimated prevalence of the best characterised HSD17B13 variant (rs72613567) ranges from 5% in Africa to 34% in East Asia. Loss-of-function variants in HSD17B13 are protective against the progression of NAFLD from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Emerging data from mechanistic and preclinical studies with RNA interference (RNAi) and small molecule agents indicate that inhibiting HSD17B13 activity may prevent NAFLD progression. CONCLUSIONS: The loss-of-function polymorphisms of the newly identified HSD17B13 gene mitigate the progression of NAFLD.

The rats were fed with HFFD-mixed puerarin for 20 weeks. The results showed that puerarin ameliorated the levels of lipids in the serum and liver. Further exploration of the mechanism found that puerarin ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD rats by reducing the expression of Srebf1, Chrebp, Acaca, Scd1, Fasn, Acacb, Cd36, Fatp5, Degs1, Plin2, and Apob100 and upregulating the expression of Mttp, Cpt1a, and Pnpla2.

Developing effective methods of diagnosis and therapy demands a deeper understanding of its molecular basis. One of the strategies in such an endeavor is the analysis of alterations in the morphology of liver cells. Such alterations, widely reported in NAFLD patients and disease models, are related to the cytoskeleton. Therefore, the fate of the cytoskeleton components is useful to uncover the molecular basis of NAFLD, to further design innovative approaches for its diagnosis and therapy. MAIN FINDINGS: Several cytoskeleton proteins are up-regulated in liver cells of NAFLD patients. Under pathological conditions, keratin 18 is released from hepatocytes and its detection in the blood emerges as a non-invasive diagnosis tool. alpha-Smooth muscle actin is up-regulated in hepatic stellate cells and its down-regulation has been widely tested as a potential NALFD therapeutic approach. Other cytoskeleton proteins, such as vimentin, are also up-regulated.

Currently, the prevalence of NAFLD in Asia is approximately 30%, as is the case in many Western countries. In Asia, the prevalence and presentation of NAFLD vary widely across regions because of the substantial diversity in race, socioeconomic status and living environment. Furthermore, the dual aetiology of fatty liver, particularly with viral hepatitis in Asia, makes it complex and challenging to manage. Because Asians are likely to have central adiposity and insulin resistance, approximately 7%-20% of non-obese Asians with body mass indexes of less than 25 kg/m(2) are estimated to have NAFLD. Accumulating evidence indicates that NAFLD is associated with various extrahepatic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, in addition to liver-specific complications. Therefore, NAFLD should be managed as a multisystem disease in conjunction with metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle modification remains the basis of NAFLD management, but few patients can achieve adequate weight loss and maintain it long term.

Recently, much research has focused on the identification of molecular mechanisms that could be translated into novel diagnostics and therapeutics. With the advent of high throughput genomics and transcriptomics, noncoding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as key players of NAFLD pathogenesis and have accordingly attracted much attention as potential diagnostics and therapeutics. In this chapter, we reviewed various lncRNAs and their functions at different stages of NAFLD. We also highlighted how these unique molecules can be developed as stage-specific non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36210072/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0065-2423(22)00043-9 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/bs.acc.2022.06.001", "pt": "Journal Article; Review", "pl": "United States"}, {"uid": 36742164, "aid": "10.3748/wjg.v29.i4.656", "titl": "COVID-19 and the liver: Are footprints still there?", "mesh": "Humans;;; *COVID-19/complications;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/epidemiology;;; Liver Cirrhosis/complications;;; Risk Factors", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Gupta, Tarana; Sharma, Hemant", "jour": "World journal of gastroenterology", "affl": "Department of Medicine, Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak 124001, Haryana, India. taranagupta@gmail.com.;;; Department of Medicine, Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak 124001, Haryana, India.", "pdat": "2023 Jan 28", "tiab": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hit the entire world as a global pandemic and soon became the most important concern for all patients with chronic diseases.

Currently, liver biopsy, as the gold standard for clinical diagnosis of NAFLD, is not widely accepted by patients due to its invasiveness. However, other non-invasive methods that had been reported for NAFLD (such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and ultrasound) still suffer from low resolution and sensitivity, which are available as a guide for liver biopsy sometimes. As a non-invasive modality with high spatiotemporal resolution and superior sensitivity, optical imaging methods have been widely favored in recent years, mainly including fluorescence imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and bioluminescence imaging. With these optical imaging approaches, a series of optical probes based on optical and molecular-specific design have been developed for the biomarker diagnosis and research of diseases. In this review, we summarize the existing non-invasive optical imaging probes for the detection of biomarkers in NAFLD, including microenvironment (viscosity, polarity), ROS, RSS, ions, proteins, and nucleic acids.

The most common causes for the rising burden of liver disease are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), and viral hepatitis. With improvements in the management of viral hepatitis over the last decades, the causes for the rising burden of liver disease are shifting toward ARLD and NAFLD. It is well-known that liver disease usually progresses silently for years or decades until the complications of cirrhosis occur. The majority of patients will not require referral to a specialist but will need further assessment in primary care. They should be evaluated for the etiology of liver disease irrespective of the duration of abnormal liver blood tests or unmarked clinical presentation. The evaluation should include a history of alcohol use, a history of medicines or herbal supplements, testing for viral hepatitis, and assessment for NAFLD, especially in obese patients and patients with type 2 diabetes. Abdominal ultrasound should be performed.

There are a large number of false positives associated with the downshift of noninvasive testing for liver fibrosis from secondary to primary care.

Its prevalence has increased in the last decades due to modern-day lifestyle factors associated with overweight and obesity, making it a relevant public health problem worldwide. The clinical progression of NAFLD is associated with advanced forms of liver injury such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As such, diverse pharmacological strategies have been implemented over the last few years, principally focused on metabolic pathways involved in NAFLD progression. However, a variable response rate has been observed in NAFLD patients, which is explained by the interindividual heterogeneity of susceptibility to liver damage. In this scenario, it is necessary to search for different therapeutic approaches. It is worth noting that chronic low-grade inflammation constitutes a central mechanism in the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD, associated with abnormal composition of the intestinal microbiota, increased lymphocyte activation in the intestine and immune effector mechanisms in liver. This review aims to discuss the current knowledge about the role of the immune response in NAFLD development. We have focused mainly on the impact of altered gut-liver-microbiota axis communication on immune cell activation in the intestinal mucosa and the role of subsequent lymphocyte homing to the liver in NAFLD development.

The explanation for this relatively recent problem is in large part due to the recent epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) increasing the risk of NAFLD. NAFLD is a silent condition that may not become manifest until severe liver damage (fibrosis or cirrhosis) has occurred. Consequently, NAFLD and its complications often remain undiagnosed. Research evidence shows that NAFLD is extremely common and some estimates suggest that it occurs in up to 70% of people with T2DM. In the last 5 years, it has become evident that NAFLD not only increases the risk of cirrhosis, primary liver cancer and end-stage liver disease, but NAFLD is also an important multisystem disease that has major implications beyond the liver. NAFLD increases the risk of incident T2DM, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and certain extra-hepatic cancers, and NAFLD and T2DM form part of a vicious spiral of worsening diseases, where one condition affects the other and vice versa. Diabetes markedly increases the risk of liver fibrosis and liver fibrosis is the most important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. It is now possible to diagnose liver fibrosis with non-invasive tools and therefore it is important to have clear care pathways for the management of NAFLD in patients with T2DM.

However, NAFLD represents a heterogeneous condition showing a wide spectrum of clinical and pathophysiological sub-phenotypes with different adverse outcomes ranging from ASCVD to liver damage progression. The contribution to NAFLD pathogenesis of different environmental, metabolic, and genetic factors underlies this heterogeneity. The more frequent phenotype of NAFLD patients is associated with metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity and insulin-resistant syndrome and this has been recently named as Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver disease (MAFLD). However, NAFLD is encountered also in subjects without insulin resistance and metabolic alterations and in whom genetic factors play a major role. It has been suggested that these individuals are at risk of liver disease progression but not of cardiovascular complications. Separating metabolic from genetic factors could be useful in disentangling the intricate relationship between NAFLD and atherosclerosis. In the present review, we aim to address the epidemic of NAFLD, its epidemiologically association with ASCVD complications and the overall mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic vascular damage in NAFLD patients.

The hepatocyte-enriched miRNA-122 is consistently increased in NAFLD and NASH but decreased in liver cirrhosis. Circulating miR-34a, part of an existing diagnostic algorithm for NAFLD, and miR-21 are consistently increased in NAFLD and NASH. MiR-192 appears to be prominently upregulated in NASH compared with NAFDL, whereas miR-193 was reported to distinguish NASH from fibrosis. Various members of miRNA cluster miR-17-92 are reported to be associated with NAFLD and NASH, although with less consistency.

Differentiated cluster 36 (CD36), a scavenger receptor class B protein, is a membrane receptor that recognizes multiple lipid and non-lipid ligands. It is generally agreed that CD36 contributes significantly to hepatic steatosis by taking part in fatty acid uptake as well as triglyceride storage and secretion. While there has not been any conclusive research on how CD36 inhibitors prevent NAFLD from progressing and no clinically approved CD36 inhibitors are currently available for use in NAFLD, CD36 remains a target worthy of further investigation in NAFLD.

Hepatic de novo lipogenesis may play an important role in the accumulation of lipids in the liver during NAFLD. Due to the importance of lipid biosynthetic fluxes in NAFLD and T2D, tracer methodologies have been developed for their study and quantification. Here, we address novel approaches to measure and quantify DNL using stable isotope tracers. Deuterated water is a widely used tracer for quantifying DNL rates in both animal models and humans. Enrichment of lipid hydrogens from (2) H2O can be resolved and quantified by (2) H NMR and MS spectroscopy of isolated lipids. NMR provides a much higher level of positional enrichment information compared with MS which yields a more detailed picture of lipid biosynthetic. It can also be used to quantify low levels of lipid (13) C enrichment from a second tracer such as [U-(13) C]sugar with minimal interference of one tracer with the other.

RECENT FINDINGS: The effectiveness of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) was compared to the existing criteria for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recent data robustly suggest the superior utility of MAFLD in identifying patients at high risk for metabolic dysfunction, the hepatic and extra-hepatic complications, as well as those who would benefit from genetic testing, including patients with concomitant liver diseases. This change in name and criteria also appears to have improved disease awareness among patients and physicians. SUMMARY: The transformation in name and definition from NAFLD to MAFLD represents an important milestone, which indicates significant tangible progress towards a more inclusive, equitable, and patient-centred approach to addressing the profound challenges of this disease. Growing evidence has illustrated the broader and specific contexts that have tremendous potential for positively influencing the diagnosis and treatment.

Low levels of physical activity and prolonged sedentary time are additional lifestyle risk factors for NAFLD. Given the present lack of effective pharmacological treatment, lifestyle modifications are regarded as the cornerstone of NAFLD management. Reducing daily calorie intake together with following the Mediterranean diet (MD) is an increasingly accepted approach. Furthermore, increasing the level of physical activity and limiting sedentary behavior are additional measures proposed to improve the outcomes of the disease. Apart from being affected by lifestyle, NAFLD may also affect patients' quality of life (QoL), mostly in the domain of physical function. In this regard, while the early and more benign form of the disease, i.e., simple hepatic steatosis, may not affect QoL, there is evidence, though conflicting, of the impact of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) on this index, with, however, most studies showing that QoL is consistently affected in advanced disease, i.e., hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of PCSK9 and explore the therapeutic effect of metformin for olanzapine-associated NAFLD. Olanzapine significantly upregulated PCSK9 and promoted lipid accumulation in mouse livers and HepG2 and AML12 cells. Metformin ameliorated these pathological alterations. PCSK9 upstream regulator liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) was significantly upregulated in olanzapine-induced NAFLD. LXRalpha antagonist treatment and LXRalpha overexpression resulted in a decrease and increase of PCSK9, respectively. Hepatic lipogenesis-associated genes FAS and SCD1 were significantly upregulated in olanzapine-induced NAFLD mice and HepG2 cells overexpressing PCSK9, and genes related to lipid beta-oxidation (SCAD and PPARalpha) were downregulated, while metformin reversed these changes. In addition, we found that LXRalpha overexpression compromised the effect of metformin on PCSK9 levels and intracellular lipid droplet formation. Taken together, our findings suggest that olanzapine enhances hepatic PCSK9 expression by upregulating LXRalpha, thereby increasing FAS and SCD1 expression as well as decreasing SCAD and PPARalpha, and promoting lipid accumulation, and, subsequently, NAFLD, which is ameliorated by metformin.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35379885/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41598-022-09610-1 https://sci-hub.do/9610 https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41598-022-09610-1", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 34923950, "aid": "CMP-EPUB-119485 10.2174/1874467215666211217120448", "titl": "Potential Natural Compounds for the Prevention and Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Review on Molecular Mechanisms.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Insulin Resistance;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/drug therapy/prevention & control", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Ma, Cheng; Wang, Cheng; Zhang, Yafang; Zhou, Honglin; Li, Yunxia", "jour": "Current molecular pharmacology", "affl": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Key Laboratory of Standardization for Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China.;;; State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Key Laboratory of Standardization for Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China.;;; State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Key Laboratory of Standardization for Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China.;;; State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Key Laboratory of Standardization for Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China.;;; State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Key Laboratory of Standardization for Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China.", "pdat": "2022", "tiab": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a kind of metabolic stress-induced liver injury closely related to insulin resistance and genetic susceptibility, and there is no specific drug for its clinical treatment currently.

The proportion of patients with more severe liver disease and the incidence of all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and cardiovascular mortality among non-obese and obese NAFLD patients varies across studies and may be confounded by selection bias, underestimation of alcohol intake, and unaccounted weight changes over time. Genetic factors may have a greater effect towards the development of NAFLD in lean or non-obese individuals, but the effect may be less pronounced in the presence of strong environmental factors, such as poor dietary choices and a sedentary lifestyle, as body mass index increases in the obese state.

METHODS: A total of 152 HCC patients with either NAFLD (n = 36) or non-NAFLD (n = 116) were retrospectively analysed from the HCC database and medical records. Chi-square and independent t-test were used to compare baseline characteristics and Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: Patients with NAFLD-HCC were more likely to be diagnosed due to symptoms rather than through screening, and at an older age, compared with non-NAFLD HCC. The median survival rates were lower in NAFLD-HCC (17.2 months) than in those with non-NAFLD-HCC (23.5 months). CONCLUSION: There is a rise in the number of HCC cases in patients with NAFLD, and this has significant implications for hepatologists as they are presented with more advanced diseases and have poorer outcomes.

We assessed NAFLD knowledge and associated factors among physicians of different specialties globally. METHODS: NAFLD knowledge surveys containing 54 and 59 questions covering 3 domains (epidemiology/pathogenesis, diagnostics, and treatment) were completed electronically by hepatologists, gastroenterologists (GEs), endocrinologists (ENDOs), and primary care physicians (PCPs) from 40 countries comprising 5 Global Burden of Disease super-regions. Over 24 months, 2202 surveys were completed (488 hepatologists, 758 GEs, 148 ENDOs, and 808 PCPs; 50% high-income Global Burden of Disease super-region, 27% from North Africa and Middle East, 12% Southeast Asia, and 5% South Asian and Latin America). RESULTS: Hepatologists saw the greatest number of NAFLD patients annually: median 150 (interquartile range, 60-300) vs 100 (interquartile range, 35-200) for GEs, 100 (interquartile range, 30-200) for ENDOs, and 10 (interquartile range, 4-50) for PCPs (all P < .0001). The primary sources of NAFLD knowledge acquisition for hepatologists were international conferences (33% vs 8%-26%) and practice guidelines for others (39%-44%). The Internet was the second most common source of NAFLD knowledge for PCPs (28%). NAFLD knowledge scores were higher for hepatologists than GEs: epidemiology, 62% vs 53%; diagnostics, 80% vs 73%; and treatment, 61% vs 58% (P < .0001), and ENDOs scores were higher than PCPs: epidemiology, 70% vs 60%; diagnostics, 71% vs 64%; and treatment, 79% vs 68% (P < .0001). Being a hepatologist or ENDO was associated with higher knowledge scores than a GE or PCP, respectively (P < .05).

Bile acid dysregulation may be a key feature in its pathogenesis and progression. AIMS: To characterise the relationship between bile acid levels and NAFLD at the population level METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Guatemala in 2016 to examine the prevalence of NAFLD. Participants (n = 415) completed questionnaires, donated blood samples and had a brief medical exam. NAFLD was determined by calculation of the fatty liver index. The levels of 15 circulating bile acids were determined by LC-MS/MS. Adjusted prevalence odds ratios (POR(adj) ) and 95% CI were calculated to examine the relationships between bile acid levels (in tertiles) and NAFLD. RESULTS: Persons with NAFLD had significantly higher levels of the conjugated primary bile acids glycocholic acid (GCA) (POR(adj T3 vs T1)  = 1.85), taurocholic acid (TCA) (POR(adj T3 vs T1)  = 2.45) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) (POR(adj T3 vs T1)  = 2.10), as well as significantly higher levels the unconjugated secondary bile acid, deoxycholic acid (DCA) (POR(adj T3 vs T1)  = 1.78) and its conjugated form, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) (POR(adj T3 vs T1)  = 1.81). CONCLUSIONS: The bile acid levels of persons with and without NAFLD differed significantly. Among persons with NAFLD, higher levels of the conjugated forms of CA (i.e. GCA, TCA) and the secondary bile acids that derive from CA (i.e. DCA, TDCA) may indicate there is hepatic overproduction of CA, which may affect the liver via aberrant signalling mediated by the bile acids.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35484638/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1111/apt.16948", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 35895614, "aid": "10.1556/650.2022.32480", "titl": "[Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Furthermore, we describe novel therapies targeting different pathogenic pathways of NAFLD, several agents that are under development specifically for the treatment of NASH. These new classes of medications may target hepatic fat accumulation, de novo lipogenesis, farnesoid X receptor-bile acid axis, oxidative stress, inflammation, gut microbiome and fibrogenesis. Until now, the use of pioglitazone and vitamin E has only been recommended by guidelines for selected patient groups with biopsy-proven NASH.

To drive this change, in this review, we present data on the current global healthcare and socioeconomic costs of NAFLD and highlight priority actions. The estimated healthcare costs of patients with NAFLD are nearly twice as high as their age-matched counterparts without the disease and are highest in those with advanced fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. NAFLD is accountable for the highest increase in DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) among all liver diseases globally. NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-specific drug therapies are not yet available and there is considerable uncertainty regarding cost, optimal length of treatment, and their impact on liver-related outcomes and mortality. Among the currently available bariatric procedures, sleeve gastrectomy is reported to be the most cost-effective for NASH resolution. Gastric bypass remains very expensive, while data on bariatric endoscopy are limited. Lastly, we propose a global NAFLD/NASH investment framework to guide the development of achievable yet ambitious country-specific targets and strategic actions to optimise resource allocation and reduce the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH.

Male Kunming mice were fed with HFD for 8 weeks to establish a mouse model of NAFLD, and SCO was used to treat NAFLD.

The histopathological results showed that HFD could lead to significant steatosis in mice, while SCO could alleviate liver steatosis remarkably in NAFLD mice. The determination of biochemical indicators showed that SCO could inhibit the increased serum transaminase activity and liver lipid level induced by HFD. RNA sequencing analysis of liver tissues found that 2742 and 3663 genes were significantly changed by HFD and SCO, respectively.

In this article, we review some of the maternal and paternal conditions that may be involved in early-life programing of adult NAFLD. First, we describe the maternal nutritional factors that have been suggested to increase the risk of NAFLD in the offspring, such as an obesogenic diet, overweight/obesity, and altered lipogenesis. Second, we review the association of certain vitamin supplementation and the use of some drugs during pregnancy, for instance, glucocorticoids, with a higher risk of NAFLD. Furthermore, we discuss the evidence showing that maternal-fetal pathologies, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), insulin resistance (IR), and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), as well as the exposure to environmental contaminants, and the impact of microbiome changes, are important factors in early-life programming of NAFLD. Finally, we review how paternal preconceptional conditions, such as exercise and diet (particularly obesogenic diets), may impact fetal growth and liver function. Altogether, the presented evidence supports the hypothesis that both in utero exposure and parental conditions may influence fetal outcomes, including the development of NAFLD in early life and adulthood.

Liver X receptors alpha/beta (LXRalpha and LXRbeta) are lipid-activated nuclear receptors that serve as master regulators of lipid homeostasis and play pivotal roles in controlling various metabolic processes, including lipid metabolism, inflammation and immune response. Of note, NAFLD progression is characterized by increased accumulation of triglycerides and cholesterol, hepatic de novo lipogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction and augmented inflammation, all of which are highly attributed to dysregulated LXR signaling. Thus, targeting LXRs may provide promising strategies for the treatment of NAFLD.

NAFLD is a slowly progressive disease that may evolve in a subset of patients toward cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. Liver fibrosis severity is the strongest predictor of clinical outcomes. The emergence of effective therapeutics on the horizon highlights the need to identify among patients with NAFLD, those with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis, who are the most at risk of developing complications and target them for therapy. Liver biopsy has been the reference standard for this purpose. However, it is not suitable for large-scale population evaluation, given its well-known limitations (invasiveness, rare but severe complications, and sampling variability). Thus, there have been major efforts to develop simple noninvasive tools that can be used in routine clinical settings and in drug development. Noninvasive approaches are based on the quantification of biomarkers in serum samples or on the measurement of liver stiffness, using either ultrasound- or magnetic resonance-based elastography techniques. This review provides a roadmap for future development and integration of noninvasive tools in clinical practice and in drug development in NAFLD.

In 2004 Clinical Science published two papers reporting on fatty acids and oxidative stress markers in the livers of patients with NAFLD; both these papers are highly cited. One paper reported an altered pattern of fatty acids within the livers of patients with NAFLD; there was a lower contribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) including both n - 6 and n - 3 PUFAs and an altered balance between n - 6 and n - 3 PUFAs in favour of the former. Ratios of precursor PUFAs to their long chain more unsaturated derivatives were altered in NAFLD and were interpreted to indicate a reduced activity of the pathway of synthesis of long chain highly unsaturated PUFAs. The authors interpreted their findings to indicate that a low hepatic content of n - 3 PUFAs has a causal role in NAFLD. The second paper reported lower hepatic antioxidant defences and increased markers of oxidative stress in NAFLD, consistent with a role for oxidative stress in the disease. Many studies have now explored the effect of supplemental n - 3 PUFAs or antioxidants, including vitamin E, in patients with NAFLD with some benefits being reported. There remains much interest in n - 3 PUFAs and antioxidants as preventive and therapeutic strategies in NAFLD and therefore it seems likely that citation of the two papers from 2004 will be sustained.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35775425/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/231526 https://sci-hub.do/10.1042/CS20220380", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 36555433, "aid": "ijms232415791 ijms-23-15791 10.3390/ijms232415791", "titl": "Genetic and Diet-Induced Animal Models for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Research.", "mesh": "Mice;;; Animals;;; Humans;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/genetics/pathology;;; Diet;;; Disease Models, Animal;;; Liver/pathology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Flessa, Christina-Maria; Nasiri-Ansari, Narjes; Kyrou, Ioannis; Leca, Bianca M; Lianou, Maria; Chatzigeorgiou, Antonios; Kaltsas, Gregory; Kassi, Eva; Randeva, Harpal S", "jour": "International journal of molecular sciences", "affl": "Department of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.;;; Warwickshire Institute for the Study of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism (WISDEM), University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry CV2 2DX, UK.;;; Department of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.;;; Warwickshire Institute for the Study of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism (WISDEM), University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry CV2 2DX, UK.;;; Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.;;; Research Institute for Health and Wellbeing, Coventry University, Coventry CV1 5FB, UK.;;; Aston Medical School, College of Health and Life Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham B4 7ET, UK.;;; Laboratory of Dietetics and Quality of Life, Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Agricultural University of Athens, 11855 Athens, Greece.;;; Warwickshire Institute for the Study of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism (WISDEM), University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry CV2 2DX, UK.;;; Department of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.;;; Department of Physiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.;;; Endocrine Unit, 1st Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.;;; Department of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.;;; Endocrine Unit, 1st Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.;;; Warwickshire Institute for the Study of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism (WISDEM), University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry CV2 2DX, UK.;;; Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.", "pdat": "2022 Dec 13", "tiab": "A rapidly increasing incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is noted worldwide due to the adoption of western-type lifestyles and eating habits.

All patients with NAFLD were compared to up to 10 controls matched for age, sex and living location. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of any cancer as ascertained from national registries. As secondary outcomes, we analysed the risk of pre-specified cancer subtypes. Cox regression models, adjusted for baseline diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were applied. RESULTS: We identified 8415 patients with NAFLD. Over a median follow-up of 6.0 years (IQR 2.5-11.2 years), an increased risk for any cancer was found in patients with NAFLD compared to controls (9.7 vs. 8.6 cases per 1000 person-years): hazard ratio (HR) = 1.22 (95% confidence interval, CI = 1.12-1.33). The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was particularly high (adjusted HR, aHR = 12.18, 95% CI = 7.15-20.79). The risk for some other cancer subtypes increased (colorectal [aHR 1.38], kidney [aHR 2.12], bladder [aHR 2.51] and uterine [aHR 1.78]), but was low in absolute terms.

Here, we analyzed the both natural compounds hypolipidemic effects on FFA-induced HepG2 cells and their potential mechanisms based on transcriptomics and experimental tests. Our results indicated that Lactucin (10 muM) and Lactucopicrin (20 muM) remarkably reduced TG accumulation. Transcriptomics analysis identified 1960, 1645, and 1791 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and obtained 611 and 635 specific genes in different comparisons, respectively. The enrichment analysis and experimental validations (RT-qPCR and Western Blot) showed that their hypolipidemic activities were most probably exerted via regulating numerous key DEGs involved in lipid metabolism. Taken together, both Lactucin and Lactucopicrin may represent potent hepatoprotective agents.

Over a dozen terpenoid compounds of natural origin were classified into five categories according to their structure: monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, and tetraterpenoids. We found that terpenoids play a therapeutic role in NAFLD, mainly by regulating lipid metabolism disorder, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The AMPK, PPARs, Nrf-2, and SIRT 1 pathways are the main targets for terpenoid treatment. Terpenoids are promising drugs and will potentially create more opportunities for the treatment of NAFLD.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of NAFLD and the probability of liver fibrosis in Italian primary care services. METHODS: We carried out a population-based and nested case-control study including all individuals aged 18 years and above registered at Italian primary care services. Data were collected from the general practitioners' network from 2010 to 2017. NAFLD cases were identified via the ICD-9-CM and Hepatic Steatosis Index score > 36 and were matched each up to 10 controls. Other causes of liver diseases were excluded. The risk of fibrosis was assessed using the FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scores (NFS). RESULTS: NAFLD was present in 9% of the primary care population with high regional variability. Among NAFLD subjects: 25% had diabetes, 10% had chronic kidney disease, 11% had cardiovascular disease and 28% were obese. Furthermore, 30% had at least two comorbidities and 13% had cirrhosis. Once cirrhosis was excluded, the risk of any degree of fibrosis was 13.8% with NFS and 20.5% with FIB-4 in subjects <65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Even if there is an identification gap in primary care, recorded cases with NAFLD have a high frequency of associated comorbidities. Despite regional variability, a close relation between cirrhosis and NAFLD exists (OR: 3.48, 95% CI: 3.23-3.76).

As the available clinical data is scarce and at least partially contradictory, we aimed at investigating a potential association between NAFLD and celiac disease in outpatients in Germany. METHODS: Using the Disease Analyzer database featuring data on diagnoses, prescriptions and demographic variables for 7.49 million cases of patients followed in general practices in Germany, we matched a total of 57 336 patients with NAFLD/diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 to a cohort of equal size without NAFLD by age, sex and index year. Incidence of celiac disease was compared between groups within 10 years from the index date. RESULTS: During the 10-years observation period, we observed a higher incidence of coeliac disease in NAFLD patients compared to patients without NAFLD (11.2 vs. 7.5 cases per 100 000 patients' years). Interestingly, this association was most prominent in men (hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.01-4.04) and patients between 18 and 50 years (hazard ratio, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.12-6.94).

However, biomarkers for NAFLD diagnosis and liver-specific drugs for treatment are lacking. This article reviews the possibility of circulating miRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD diseases and focuses on several well-studied miRNAs to provide preclinical data for subsequent related studies. METHODS: Related articles were identified through searches of the PubMed database for literature published from 2010 to December 2022. Search terms included NAFLD, microRNA, biomarker, diagnosis, and therapy. FINDINGS: Current research data indicate that some key circulating miRNAs may be used as diagnostic biomarkers of NAFLD and the combination of several miRNAs improves diagnostic performance. In addition, some preclinical trials using cell and mouse models provide a basis for some miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets. IMPLICATIONS: Current evidence suggests that circulating miRNAs are potential noninvasive biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of NAFLD, which needs to be validated in more heterogeneous and larger cohorts. In addition, several miRNAs regulate multiple downstream pathways related to the pathophysiology of NAFLD in a cell- and tissue-specific manner, making them attractive drug therapeutic targets for NAFLD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study enrolled 3216 children with obesity from January 2003 to May 2021. They were divided into obese without NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) groups. Clinical data were retrieved, and gender and chronologic characteristics were compared between groups. Data from the training set (3036) were assessed using univariate analyses and stepwise multivariate logistic regression, by which a nomogram was developed to estimate the probability of NAFLD. Another 180 cases received additional liver hydrogen proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) as a validation set. RESULTS: The prevalence of NAFLD was higher in males than in females and has increased over the last 19 years. In total, 1915 cases were NAFLD, and the peak onset age was 10-12 years old. Hyperuricemia ranked first in childhood NAFLD comorbidities, followed by dyslipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and dysglycemia. The AUROC of the eight-parameter nomogram, including waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), hip circumference (HC), triglyceride glucose-waist circumference (TyG-WC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A1(ApoA1), insulin sensitivity index [ISI (composite)], and gender, for predicting NAFLD was 0.913 (sensitivity 80.70%, specificity 90.10%). Calibration curves demonstrated a great calibration ability of the model. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: NAFLD is the most common complication in children with obesity.

Presence of T2D increases the risk of progression of simple steatosis to more severe liver conditions, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis (NASH-fibrosis). Since majority of patients with T2D are managed by diabetologists (including physicians and endocrinologists), their roles in the management of coexisting NAFLD are not well defined, partly due to lack of unambiguous guidelines. METHODS: A literature search was performed with Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Google Scholar electronic databases till January 2022, using relevant keywords (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetologist; screening of NASH; management of NASH) to extract relevant studies describing prevention and screening of NAFLD/NASH, especially in people with T2D. RESULTS: Diabetologists have two main roles for the management of patients with T2D and coexisting NAFLD. The most important role is to prevent the development of NASH-fibrosis in patients with simple steatosis (primary prevention). This can be achieved by reinforcing the importance of lifestyle measures, and by early use of glucose-lowering agents with beneficial effects on the liver. The second important role of diabetologists is to screen all patients with T2D for liver fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis, and provide appropriate referral for timely management of complications (secondary prevention). CONCLUSION: Diabetologists can play a central role in mitigating the epidemic of NAFLD in individuals with T2D. However, diabetologists need to be aware about their roles in NASH-fibrosis prevention and screening. Furthermore, longitudinal studies should explore the role of newer glucose-lowering drugs in the primary prevention of NASH-fibrosis in individuals with coexisting T2D and simple steatosis.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35259705/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S1871-4021(22)00060-1 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.dsx.2022.102446", "pt": "Journal Article; Review", "pl": "Netherlands"}, {"uid": 34962132, "aid": "10.17235/reed.2021.8524/2021", "titl": "Can NAFLD overwhelm the Spanish healthcare system in the years to come?", "mesh": "Delivery of Health Care;;; *End Stage Liver Disease;;; Humans;;; *Liver Transplantation;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/epidemiology/therapy;;; Spain/epidemiology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Crespo, Javier; Iruzubieta, Paula; Lazarus, Jeffrey V", "jour": "Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas", "affl": "Aparato Digestivo, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, 39002.;;; Aparato Digestivo, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla.;;; Barcelona Institute for Global Health, (ISGlobal-CRESIB, Hospital Clinic.

Three hundred and fifty seven NAFLD patients were enrolled, all previously instructed to follow a Mediterranean diet (MD). Anthropometric, metabolic, and laboratory data were collected before the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy and 6 months apart, along with ultrasound (US) steatosis grading and information about adherence to MD and physical activity (PA). In 188 patients, PNPLA3 genotyping was performed. After the lockdown, 48% of patients gained weight, while 16% had a worsened steatosis grade. Weight gain was associated with poor adherence to MD (p = 0.005), reduced PA (p = 0.03), and increased prevalence of PNPLA3 GG (p = 0.04). At multivariate analysis (corrected for age, sex, MD, PA, and PNPLA3 GG), only PNPLA3 remained independently associated with weight gain (p = 0.04), which was also associated with worsened glycemia (p = 0.002) and transaminases (p = 0.02).

METHODS: HFD-fed NAFLD mice were treated with the vehicle and 80 mg/kg Sin A every day for 6 weeks. The gut permeability of the NAFLD mice was assessed by intestinal permeability assays in vivo and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements in vitro were also used to evaluate the function of the gut barrier. TLR4 inhibitor was then used to investigate the impact of Sin A in the LPS- TLR4 signaling pathway. Alternatively, the composition of the microbiome was assessed using 16S rRNA amplification. Finally, the experiment of antibiotic treatment was performed to elucidate the roles of the gut microbiome mediating Sin A induced metabolic benefits in the NAFLD mice. RESULTS: We found that Sin A potently ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation, alleviated gut inflammation, and restored intestinal barrier function. We also observed that Sin A improved gut permeability and reduced the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into circulation and further found that Sin A can suppress LPS-TLR4 signaling to protect against HFD-induced NAFLD. Sin A treatment altered the composition of the microbiome in NAFLD mice compared to vehicle controls.

The aim of the study was to determine whether monkfish peptides (LPs) could ameliorate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD and its underlying mechanisms. NAFLD was induced in mice by giving them an HFD for eight weeks, after which LPs were administered in various dosages. In comparison to the HFD control group: body weight in the LP-treated groups decreased by 23-28%; triacylglycerol levels in the blood decreased by 16-35%; and low-density lipoproteins levels in the blood decreased by 23-51%. Additionally, we found that LPs elevated the activity of hepatic antioxidant enzymes and reduced the inflammatory reactions within fatty liver tissue. Investigating the effect on metabolic pathways, we found that in LP-treated mice: the levels of phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), and phospho-acetyl CoA carboxylase (p-ACC) in the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway were up-regulated and the levels of downstream sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP-1) were down-regulated; lipid oxidation increased and free fatty acid (FFA) accumulation decreased (revealed by the increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) and the decreased fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression, respectively); the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway was activated; and the levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nicotinamide quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) were increased.

Yet, the impact of NAFLD on outcomes, along with the contribution of nonmetabolic factors to NAFLD development, is unclear. To investigate these topics, we conducted a nationwide study examining the impact of NAFLD on hospitalization outcomes in IBD patients after adjusting for metabolic factors. METHODS: Patients with IBD-related hospitalizations were identified using the Nationwide Readmissions Database from 2016 to 2018. Inflammatory bowel disease patients with and without NAFLD were matched based on IBD type, age, sex, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. Primary outcomes were IBD-related readmission, IBD-related surgery, and death. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS) and cost of care (COC). The primary multivariable model adjusted for obesity, dyslipidemia, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index, hospital characteristics, payer, patient income, and elective status of admissions. RESULTS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with a higher risk of IBD-related readmission (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.90; P < .01) and death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.73; P < .01), 0.71-day longer LOS (P < .01), and $7312 higher COC (P < .01) in those with Crohn's disease. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was also associated with a higher risk of IBD-related readmission (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.65; P < .01), 0.64-day longer LOS (P < .01), and $9392 (P < .01) higher COC, but there was no difference in death in those with UC. No differences in risk of IBD-related surgery were observed.

Meanwhile, disordered bile acids influence the gut microbiota mainly through promoting the bacterial death and lowering the microbial diversity. Although weight loss and lifestyle changes are effective in the treatment of NAFLD, the acceptability and compliance of patients are poor.

This review examines the relationship between metabolic dysfunction and clinical characteristics associated with NAFLD in normal-weight individuals. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite a more favorable metabolic profile, normal-weight NAFLD patients exhibit metabolic dysfunction. Visceral adiposity may be a critical risk factor for NAFLD in normal-weight individuals, and waist circumference may be better than BMI for assessing metabolic risk in these patients. Although screening for NAFLD is not presently recommended, recent guidelines may assist clinicians in the diagnosis, staging, and management of NAFLD in individuals with a normal BMI.

RESULTS: Of the 38 articles included, 14 reported prevalence of clinical coronary artery disease (CAD) and 24 subclinical CAD. The pooled prevalence of CHD was 44.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.0%-53.6%) among 67,070 patients with NAFLD with an odds ratio of 1.33 (95% CI, 1.21%-1.45%; P &lt; .0001). The prevalence of CHD was higher in patients with moderate to severe steatosis (37.5%; 95% CI, 15.0%-67.2%) than those with mild steatosis (29.6%; 95% CI, 13.1%-54.0%). The pooled prevalence of subclinical and clinical CAD was 38.7% (95% CI, 29.8%-48.5%) and 55.4% (95% CI, 39.6%-70.1%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Steatosis was found to be related with CHD involvement, with moderate to severe steatosis related to clinical CAD.

We aim to evaluate the association between NAFLD and aortic calcification in a cohort of Chinese adults using propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. METHODS: This prospective cohort study involved adults who underwent health-screening examinations from 2009 to 2016. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography at baseline, and aortic calcification was identified using a VCT LightSpeed 64 scanner. Analyses included Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis and PSM with predefined covariates (age, gender, marital and smoking status, and use of lipid-lowering drugs) to achieve a 1:1 balanced cohort. RESULTS: Of the 6,047 eligible participants, 2,729 (45.13%) were diagnosed with NAFLD at baseline, with a median age of 49.0 years [interquartile range, 44.0-55.0]. We selected 2,339 pairs of participants with and without NAFLD at baseline for the PSM subpopulation. Compared with those without NAFLD, patients with NAFLD were at a higher risk of developing aortic calcification during follow-up; significant results were observed before and after matching, with the full-adjusted hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals being 1.19 (1.02-1.38) and 1.18 (1.01-1.38), respectively (both p < 0.05). In subgroup analyses, no interaction was detected according to age, gender, smoking status, body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, use of lipid-lowering drugs, hypertension, or type 2 diabetes.

RESULTS: We initially identified a novel functional probiotic, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW3, on the lipid deposition by a simple and rapid zebrafish model. Supplementation with ZW3 to the methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NAFLD rats could improve the liver impairments and reduce inflammation through TLR4-MyD88 and JNK signaling pathways. Moreover, ZW3 modulated gut microbiota by promoting relative abundance of Firmicutes and Lactobacillus, decreasing the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Bacteroides. Functional prediction of microbiome showed ZW3 presented potential enhancement on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cell process control and signal transduction processes, and reduced several human diseases. CONCLUSION: This present study identified a novel probiotic and its protective effects on NAFLD, and interpreted the interactions of ZW3 with the immune system and gut microbiota involved in gut-liver axis.

Metabolic distress (obese diabetes) is the main causative element of NAFLD. While there is no cure for NAFLD, endurance exercise (EEx) has emerged as a therapeutic strategy against NAFLD. However, mechanisms of EXE-induced hepatic protection especially in female subjects remain unidentified. Thus, the aim of the study is to examine molecular mechanisms of EXE-induced hepatic protection against diet-induced NAFLD in female mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nine-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal-diet control group (CON, n=11); high-fat diet/high-fructose group (HFD/HF, n=11); and HFD/HF+EEx group (HFD/HF+EEx, n=11). The mice assigned to HFD/HF and HFD/HF+EEx groups were fed with HFD/HF for 12 weeks, after which the mice assigned to the EEx group began treadmill exercise for 12 weeks, with HFD/HF continued. RESULTS: EEx attenuated hepatic steatosis, reduced de novo lipogenesis (reduction in ATP-Citrate- Lyase and diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferase 1), and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty-acid activation (oxidative phosphorylation enzymes and Acyl-CoA synthetase1). Also, EEx prevented upregulation of gluconeogenic proteins (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase1), premature senescence (suppression of p53, p22, and p16, tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha, and interleukin-1beta, and oxidative stress), and autophagy deficiency. Furthermore, EXE reversed apoptosis arrest (cleaved cysteine-dependent-aspartate-directed protease3 and Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase1). CONCLUSION: EEx-mediated reparations of metabolic and redox imbalance (utilization of pentose phosphate pathway), and autophagy deficiency caused by metabolic distress critically contribute to preventing/delaying severe progression of NAFLD.

Epidemiological studies of NAFLD/NASH in China were particularly noticed and summarized. We also searched the www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov and www.chictr.org.cn websites for the registered trials on the treatment of the disease led by Chinese investigators or located in China. RESULTS: The increasing rate of NAFLD prevalence in China is strikingly high, reaching more than twice that in western countries. The prevalence of NAFLD is nearly 30% of the general Chinese population, making it the leading cause of chronic liver diseases. The prevalence of NAFLD/NASH varies between provinces/regions, age groups, sexes, and individuals with different metabolic profiles. NAFLD co-exists in many Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B. Since 2020, more Chinese studies have used the term metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), emphasizing the underlying metabolic disorders that occur concurrently with this disease. Several clinical trials involving lifestyle interventions, antidiabetic drugs, or traditional Chinese medicines, registered by Chinese investigators, have been completed or are ongoing. Moreover, several innovative targeted therapies developed in China are revolutionizing the treatment of NAFLD/NASH. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD has cast a heavy burden on the Chinese healthcare system.

Particularly morbidly obese patients are at risk of developing progressive liver disease. Nutritional and lifestyle intervention is recommended as the standard of care in NAFLD. However, there is a striking lack of evidence to support the efficacy of lifestyle intervention to treat NAFLD in morbidly obese patients. Here, we aimed to assess the impact of lifestyle intervention on NAFLD in the morbidly obese in a real-world setting. METHODS: 136 obese patients were included in an industry-independent, multiprofessional lifestyle intervention program with a lead-in phase of 12 weeks of formula diet and a total of 48 weeks intensive counselling. Body weight and markers of the metabolic syndrome were analyzed. Presence of NAFLD was screened for by use of non-invasive markers of fatty liver, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. RESULTS: Weight loss goals (i.e. > 5% or > 10% of initial body weight, respectively, depending on baseline BMI) were achieved in 89.7% of subjects in the intention-to-treat analysis and 93.9% in the per-protocol analysis. This was associated with a pronounced improvement in serum ALT values. The percentage of subjects who fulfilled non-invasive criteria for fatty liver dropped from 95.2 to 54.8%.

We evaluated the competitive risk occurrence of LRE and EHE in a large cohort of biopsy-proven NAFLD stratified according to baseline severity of fibrosis. METHODS: Two thousand one hundred thirty-five patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were enrolled. Observed cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) were used to evaluate the risk of LRE and EHE; cause-specific Cox model and predicted CIFs were fitted to identify predictors of LRE and EHE. A replication cohort of NAFLD patients with liver fibrosis severity estimated by liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography was also enrolled. RESULTS: Observed CIFs indicated that the 60-month probabilities of LRE and EHE were 0.2% and 3% in F0-F1, 2% and 3.8% in F2 and 9.7% and 6.4% in F3-F4 patients, respectively. The cause-specific Cox model indicated that in F0-F1 and F2 patients, age > 50 years (HR 2.7) was the only predictor of LRE, while age > 50 years (HR 2.96), previous cardiovascular events (CVE, HR 2.07), and previous extra-hepatic cancer (HR 2.36) were independent risk factors for EHE. In F3-F4 patients, age > 55 years (HR 1.73), obesity (HR 1.52), PLT < 150 000/mmc (HR 3.66) and log(GGT) (HR 1.77) were associated with LRE, while age > 55 years (HR 1.74) and previous CVE (HR 2.51) were independent predictors of EHE. Predicted CIFs for HE and EHE in F0-F1, F2 and F3-F4 patients stratified the risk of events. The results were externally replicated.

We provided an overview of the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19)-farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis and summarized the latest findings derived from animal and human studies concerning the impact of FGF-19 on NAFLD. EXPERT OPINION: FGF-19, a nutritionally regulated endocrine post-prandial hormone, governs bile acid metabolism, lipid oxidation, lipogenesis, and energy homeostasis. As no approved medication for NAFLD exists, FGF-19 seems to be a propitious therapeutic opportunity for NAFLD, since its administration was associated with ameliorated results in hepatic steatosis, liver inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, promising results have been derived from clinical trials concerning the beneficial efficacy of FGF-19 on histological findings and laboratory parameters of NAFLD. However, we should bear in mind the pleiotropic effects of FGF-19 on various metabolically active tissues along with its potential tumorigenic reservoir.

Obesity was originally seen as a condition, not a disease, which was considered self-inflicted. Thus, it was understandable that a simplistic approach, such as eat less and move more was proposed to manage obesity. Over the last 25 years, the perception of obesity has been gradually changing and the awareness has risen that it is a disease in its own right and not just a precipitating factor for type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), etc. Creation of a comprehensive algorithm for the management of obesity needs to be informed by an in-depth understanding of the issues impacting the provision of treatment. Promotion of healthy behaviours is essential to help the population become healthier, but these are not obesity treatment strategies. Twenty percent of patients with obesity may respond to approaches based on healthy behaviour, but the 80% who do not respond should not be stigmatised but rather their treatment should be escalated. The unintended consequences of promoting healthy behaviours to patients with obesity can be mitigated by understanding that obesity is likely to be a subset of complex diseases, that require chronic disease management.

The use of 16S rDNA technology showed that while there were no significant changes in the alpha diversity in the cecum of NAFLD mice, the beta diversity changed significantly.

Amino acids, lipids, bile acids and nucleotide metabolites were among the 167 significantly different metabolites selected. The metabolic pathways of amino acids, SFAs, and bile acids were significantly enhanced, while the metabolic pathways of PUFAs, vitamins, and nucleotides were significantly inhibited.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We conducted an anonymous survey in France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States among physicians providing specialist care for patients with NAFLD. Modalities of patient referral, patterns of practice (diagnosis, staging, monitoring, and indications for liver biopsy), therapeutic management, and expectations for future NASH pharmacotherapies were assessed, with 664 physicians completing the survey. Referral to surveyed physicians (SPs) mostly came from primary care. Prior to referral, NAFLD was rarely diagnosed, and noninvasive tests were not performed. Screening for comorbidities by SPs was incomplete and cardiovascular risk not calculated. Elastometry in combination with a serum biomarker was the most common first-line method for fibrosis staging. Liver biopsy, when performed, was often delayed by at least 1 year after diagnosis. It was, however, recommended even if noninvasive methods indicated advanced fibrosis. Frequent, biannual monitoring was conducted, including HCC surveillance in Stage 3 fibrosis. SPs rarely implemented and followed dietary and lifestyle changes themselves, and local availability of such programs was highly heterogenous.

Metformin, silymarin, and other nonspecific medications are used in the management of NAFLD. Aside from this available medicine, maintaining a healthy lifestyle has been emphasized as a means of combating this. Epigenetics, which has been attributed to NAFLD, is another essential feature of this disease that has emerged as a result of several sorts of research. The mechanisms by which DNA methylation, noncoding RNA, and histone modification promote NAFLD have been extensively researched. Another organelle, mitochondria, which play a pivotal role in biological processes, contributes to the global threat. Individuals with NAFLD have been documented to have a multitude of alterations and malfunctioning. Mitochondria are mainly concerned with the process of energy production and regulation of the signaling pathway on which the fate of a cell relies. Modulation of mitochondria leads to elevated lipid deposition in the liver. Further, changes in oxidation states result in an impaired balance between the antioxidant system and reactive oxygen species directly linked to mitochondria. Hence mitochondria have a definite role in potentiating NAFLD.

Our purpose is to investigate the prevalence, clinical characteristics and possible indicators for NAFLD in a cohort of Chinese patients with CD. METHODS: Established CD patients who underwent magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) at the gastroenterology unit of our hospital were consecutively enrolled between June 2018 and May 2020. The diagnosis of NAFLD was made by magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction (MR-PDFF) maps. Medical records during hospitalization were collected and examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Then a predictive model was constructed based on logistic regression analysis to evaluate the risk of developing NAFLD. RESULTS: A total of 340 CD subjects were enrolled in this study, 83 (24.4%) suffered from NAFLD. Compared with those without NAFLD, patients with NAFLD showed longer disease duration, higher body mass index (BMI), more frequent use of corticosteroid and pronouncedly elevated liver function tests. The comparison showed no difference in terms of prolonged anti tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) use (> 54w). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI, serum transaminase, pre-albumin and disease duration could independently predict hepatic steatosis. CONCLUSION: NAFLD is frequent in chronic CD patients, while long term use of anti TNF-alpha seems to have no impact on the development of NAFLD in this population.

Traditional ultrasound methods include qualitative B-mode for imaging markers, such as increased hepatic parenchymal echogenicity compared to adjacent renal cortex are commonplace; however, there is acknowledged significant interobserver variability and they are suboptimal for detecting mild steatosis.

These methods rely on changes in backscatter, attenuation, and speed of sound differences encountered in a steatotic liver. Prospective studies using quantitative ultrasound parameters show good diagnostic performance even at low steatosis grades and in NAFLD.

Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model was used to examine the associations between cumulative average total intake of Mg (dietary plus supplemental) and NAFLD odds. RESULTS: A total of 629 NAFLD cases were documented. After adjustment for potential confounders, an inverse association between total Mg intake and NAFLD odds was observed. Compared to participants in the lowest quintile of total Mg intake, the odds of NAFLD was 55% lower among individuals in the highest quintile [multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.23, 0.85), p for trend = 0.03].

METHODS: A representative sample of adults aged 30-60 years were recruited from urban Delhi and rural Ballabhgarh during 2017-2019. Participants underwent abdominal ultrasonography (USG) and vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) with FibroScan to assess fatty liver and fibrosis, respectively. We estimated the age- and sex-standardised prevalence of NAFLD and its spectrum. The factors associated with 'ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD' were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 828 urban (mean +/- SD age: 45.5 +/- 8.0 years; women: 52.7%) and 832 rural (mean +/- SD age: 45.1 +/- 7.9 years; women: 62.4%) participants were recruited.

METHODS: Health practitioners (n = 24) recruited from multidisciplinary diabetes clinics in primary care (n = 3) and hospital (n = 1) settings participated in four focus group discussions, and common themes were identified using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Lack of knowledge and access to resources were key factors that underpinned an inconsistent approach by clinicians to NAFLD diagnosis and risk stratification and impacted their confidence to discuss the diagnosis with patients. Participants often prioritised other medical issues above NAFLD due to lack of concern about liver-related consequences, reluctance to overburden patients with information, lack of time and perceived absence of accessible fibrosis tests. All participants agreed that implementation of a NAFLD pathway would improve patient care and the general practitioners proposed that screening for NAFLD could be incorporated into routine review cycles for type 2 diabetes. A consistent message from participants was that educating patients about their liver disease needs to be implemented in an integrated care pathway. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspectives of health practitioners, there is a gap in clinical practice for the implementation of clear, evidence-based guidelines for NAFLD in people with T2D.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the impact of ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid (FA/p-CA) on non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). The association of FA and p-CA with fatty liver was first analyzed by network pharmacology. Synergistic ameliorating of NAFLD by FA and p-CA was verified in oleic acid (OA) and palmitic acid (PA) (FFA)-treated hepatocytes. Meanwhile, FA/p-CA suppressed final body weight and TG content and improved liver dysfunction in HFD-induced NAFLD mice. Mechanistically, our data indicated that FA and p-CA bind to histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to inhibit its expression. The results showed that peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG), which is positively related to HDAC1, was inhibited by FA/p-CA, and further suppressed fatty acid binding protein (FABP) and fatty acid translocase (CD36).

METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on physical examination data from Japan. Patients were divided into quartiles (Q1-Q4) according to their HGI level; the lowest quartile (Q1) was used as the reference group. Patents were also classified into two subgroups based on the presence or absence of NAFLD. Baseline characteristics between the groups were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between the HGI and NAFLD. A mediation analysis examined the mediation relationship between HGI and NAFLD. Subgroup analyses were performed to the reliability of the results. RESULTS: A total of 14280 patients were eligible for inclusion in this study; 2515 had NAFLD. Patients in the NAFLD group had higher levels of HGI than patients in the non-NAFLD group. Increases in HGI correlated with an increased risk of NAFLD. After adjusting for confounding factors, the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that HGI was positively related to the prevalence of NAFLD. In addition, mediation analysis showed that body mass index (BMI) partly mediated the indirect impact of HGI on NAFLD preference. Subgroup analyses were performed according to age, sex, smoking status, and waist circumference. Our results indicated that HGI significantly correlated with NAFLD in patients with one of the following factors: age </=60 years, BMI >28 kg/m(2), female sex, a history of smoking, and abdominal obesity. CONCLUSIONS: HGI was an independent risk factor for NAFLD, and BMI partly mediated the association between HGI and NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36824362/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fendo.2023.1094101", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland"}, {"uid": 36655643, "aid": "10.7417/CT.2023.2495", "titl": "Association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and carotid intima-media thickness.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Carotid Intima-Media Thickness;;; Cross-Sectional Studies;;; *Metabolic Syndrome/complications/epidemiology;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology;;; Risk Factors", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Vu, H; Khanh Tuong, T T; Hoang Lan, N; Quoc Thang, T; Bilgin, K; Hoa, T; Minh Duc, N; The Dung, B", "jour": "La Clinica terapeutica", "affl": "Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Viet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;;; Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;;; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Viet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;;; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Viet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;;; Yildiz Technical University, Intelligent Healthcare Innovation Research Center, Istanbul, Turkey.;;; Department of Radiology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia.;;; Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.;;; Department of Radiology, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;;; Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center HCMC, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.", "pdat": "2023 Jan-Feb", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Many non-invasive methods have been studied for assessing the severity of fatty liver disease and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT).

METHODS: The study population included 608,994 adults aged >/=60 years who underwent health examinations between 2009 and 2010. Data were collected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. NAFLD was assessed using the fatty liver index (FLI). A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the association between NAFLD and dementia. RESULTS: During the 6,495,352 person-years of follow-up, 48,538 participants (8.0%) developed incident dementia.

However, whether myeloid cell MyD88 contributes to NAFLD are largely unknown. To test this approach, we generated macrophage-specific MyD88 knockout mice and show that these mice are protected against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic injury, lipid accumulation, and fibrosis. These protective effects were associated with reduced macrophage numbers in liver tissues and surpassed inflammatory responses. In cultured macrophages, saturated fatty acid palmitate utilizes MyD88 to activate NF-kappaB and induce inflammatory and fibrogenic factors. In hepatocytes, these factors may cause lipid accumulation and a further elaboration of inflammatory cytokines. In hepatic stellate cells, macrophage-derived factors, especially TGF-beta, cause activation and hepatic fibrosis. We further show that pharmacological inhibition of MyD88 is also able to reduce NAFLD injury in HFD-fed mice. Therefore, our study has provided empirical evidence that macrophage MyD88 participates in HFD-induced NAFLD and could be targeted to prevent the development and progression of NAFLD/NASH.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35811033/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0925-4439(22)00151-X https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.bbadis.2022.166480", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Netherlands"}, {"uid": 36594051, "aid": "10.1155/2022/8435581", "titl": "Screening Patterns of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children with Obesity in Canadian Primary Care: A Cross-Sectional Study.", "mesh": "Humans;;; Child;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/complications;;; Cross-Sectional Studies;;; Canada/epidemiology;;; Obesity/epidemiology;;; Body Mass Index;;; Primary Health Care", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Morkem, Rachael; Theal, Rebecca; Barber, David; Flemming, Jennifer; Queenan, John; Kehar, Mohit", "jour": "Canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology", "affl": "Department of Family Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.;;; Department of Family Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.;;; Department of Family Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.;;; Departments of Medicine and Public Health Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.;;; Department of Family Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.;;; Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.", "pdat": "2022", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common pediatric chronic liver disease, and children with a body mass index (BMI) >/=95th percentile are recommended to be screened for NAFLD by liver enzymes.

The published prevelance in epidemiological studies in this high risk population exceeds 70%. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the impact of NAFLD on T2D patients in Germany. METHODS: Using the Disease Analyzer Database (IQVIA), T2D patients with NAFLD diagnosed in Germany were matched to a cohort without NAFLD controlling for age, sex, physician, index year and metabolic comorbidities and assessed for their risk of developing myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or chronic kidney disease, as well as the type of T2D treatment on NAFLD. RESULTS: 2633 T2D patients with NAFLD were matched to 2633 T2D patients without liver disease. The ICD coded prevalence of NAFLD in patients with T2D in primary care in Germany was 7.8%. On regression analysis of patients with T2D , the presence of NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of renal failure during follow-up (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.34, p=0.027). No association with the development of myocardial infarction, stroke, PAD or initiation of insulin therapy was observed. NAFLD patients were more frequently treated with DDP-4 inhibitors (+/-metformin) and less frequently with insulin within the first year of T2D diagnosis.

In recent years, the risk of ASCVD has increased along with the prevalence of NAFLD. ASCVD events are highly prevalent and are the main contributor to death in patients with NAFLD. The association between NAFLD and ASCVD has been validated in numerous observational, cohort, and genetic studies. Most of these studies agree that NAFLD significantly increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis and ASCVD. In addition, the underlying proatherosclerotic mechanisms of NAFLD have been gradually revealed; both disorders share several common pathophysiologic mechanisms including insulin resistance, whereas systemic inflammation and dyslipidemia driven by NAFLD directly promote atherosclerosis. Recently, NAFLD, as an emerging risk enhancer for ASCVD, has attracted attention as a potential treatment target for ASCVD.

METHODS: Total 290 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD (n = 124) and 108 control patients were included in the study. To exclude the effect of other diseases on MPV, we included 156 patient controls in our study. Those whohave liver-related diseases and those who use drugs that may cause fatty liver were not included in the study. Liver biopsy was performed for those whose alanine aminotransferase level persisted for >6 months above the upper limits. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: We found that MPV was significantly higher in the NAFLD group compared with the control group, and MPV had an independent predictive value for the development of NAFLD. We determined that the number of platelets was significantly lower in the NAFLD group compared with that in the control group. We compared MPV values histologically with both stage and grade in all patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and found that MPV had a significant positive correlation with stage. We observed a positive correlation between MPV and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis grade, but this was not statistically significant. MPV can be useful because it is simple, easy to measure, cost-effective, and routinely tested in daily practice.

Computer-assisted web interviews were completed. GEs provided information from patient records. RESULTS: Mean experience was 14.2 (95 GEs) and 22.6 (115 GPs) years. Mean patient numbers with liver disorders consulted per month were 36 (13%; GEs) and 51 (6%; GPs); ~50% were patients with NAFLD. All GEs/GPs used ultrasound; most evaluated transaminases and gamma-glutamyl transferase. More GEs used other imaging techniques and a larger spectrum of laboratory tests than GPs. Physician-identified NAFLD key symptoms were similar for GEs/GPs. GEs noticed less obvious symptoms (abdominal discomfort, drowsiness, fatigability, lack of energy) vs. GPs (abdominal pain/discomfort, dyspepsia). Common comorbidities in NAFLD were similar in GE/GP responses. NAFLD interventions by GEs/GPs (% patients) were diet/lifestyle/pharmacological interventions (54%/59%), diet/lifestyle changes alone (41%/31%) or pharmacological interventions alone (5%/10%). The top three criteria for supportive pharmacological selection were efficacy, tolerability and quality of life improvement for GEs/GPs.

To evaluate the relationship between the severity of NAFLD and CVEs among patients with prehypertension or hypertension. METHODS: In this prospective community-based Kailuan cohort, participants without cardiovascular disease and alcohol abuse, or other liver diseases were enrolled. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. Prehypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) of 120-139 mmHg or diastolic BP of 80-89 mmHg. Participants with NAFLD were divided into mild, moderate, and severe subgroups. Follow-up for CVEs including myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs of CVEs according to the severity of NAFLD and hypertensive statutes. The C-statistic was used to evaluate the efficiency of models. RESULTS: A total of 71926 participants (mean [SD] age, 51.83 [12.72] years, 53794 [74.79%] men, and 18132 [25.21%] women) were enrolled in this study, 6,045 CVEs occurred during a median of 13.02 (0.65) years of follow-up. Compared with participants without NAFLD, the hazard ratios of CVEs for patients with mild, moderate, and severe NAFLD were 1.143 (95% CI 1.071-1.221, P < 0.001), 1.218 (95% CI 1.071-1.221, P < 0.001), and 1.367 (95% CI 1.172-1.595, P < 0.001), respectively. Moreover, participants with prehypertension plus moderate/severe NAFLD and those with hypertension plus moderate/severe NAFLD had 1.558-fold (95% CI 1.293-1.877, P < 0.001) and 2.357-fold (95% CI 2.063-2.691, P < 0.001) higher risks of CVEs, respectively, compared with those with normal BP and no NAFLD. Adding a combination of NAFLD and BP status to the crude Cox model increased the C-statistic by 0.0130 (0.0115-0.0158, P < 0.001).

The aim of this study was to use genetic epidemiology to study the association between de novo lipogenesis (DNL), one of the major pathways leading to NAFLD, and CAD risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNL susceptibility genes were used as instruments and selected using three approaches: 1) genes that are associated with both high serum triglycerides and low sex hormone-binding globulin, both downstream consequences of DNL (unbiased approach), 2) genes that have a known role in DNL (biased approach), and 3) genes that have been associated with serum fatty acids, used as a proxy of DNL. Gene-CAD effect estimates were retrieved from the meta-analysis of CARDIoGRAM and the UK Biobank ( approximately 76014 cases and  approximately 264785 controls). Effect estimates were clustered using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Twenty-two DNL susceptibility genes were identified by the unbiased approach, nine genes by the biased approach and seven genes were associated with plasma fatty acids. Clustering of genes selected in the unbiased and biased approach showed a statistically significant association with CAD (OR:1.016, 95%CI:1.012; 1.020 and OR:1.013, 95%CI:1.007; 1.020, respectively), while clustering of fatty acid genes did not (OR:1.004, 95%CI:0.996-1.011). Subsequent exclusion of potential influential outliers did reveal a statistically significant association (OR:1.009, 95%CI:1.000; 1.018).

Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP, defined as the logarithm of the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio.) can provide a stronger reflection of dyslipidemia and studies on the longitudinal association between AIP and NAFLD were limited in non-obese participants, especially in different BMI groups. METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of data obtained from the Dryad data repository (Dryad is a nonprofit open database of medicine.) and explored the predictive value of AIP on the risk of NAFLD among non-obese participants. RESULTS: This study included 16173 participants with AIP, of which 2322(14.4%) non-obese participants developed into individuals with NAFLD with the 5-year follow-up examination. The difference between AIP quartiles in the cumulative estimation of new-onset NAFLD was significant, and with increased AIP, the cumulative new-onset NAFLD gradually increased. Participants in higher AIP quartiles had a significantly increased risk of NAFLD. In the fully adjusted model 3, hazard ratios of the new-onset NAFLD for subjects in Q2, Q3, and Q4 of AIP were 2.00 (1.59, 2.53), 2.61 (2.09, 3.72), and 4.49 (3.62, 5.57) respectively. Meanwhile, the trend test for the association between AIP quartiles and the new-onset NAFLD presented that AIP quartile was positively and strongly associated with the new-onset NAFLD (adjusted hazard ratio (95%CI) in Model 3: 1.59 (1.51, 1.67), P<0.001). We found that AIP was also positively and strongly associated with new-onset NAFLD in different sex groups and different age groups in female patients. Moreover, the predictive ability of AIP was no significant difference in different sex groups and different age groups in female patients. In the subgroup analysis, we found that in the low BMI population, the predictive effect of AIP for new-onset NAFLD was expanded by 2-3 times for each quality increase of AIP. CONCLUSION: This study found that AIP was a strong independent risk factor for new-onset NAFLD among non-obese individuals especially in the low BMI participants, and screening for AIP in this population can be used to prevent future NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36060971/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fendo.2022.969783", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland"}, {"uid": 34678858, "aid": "00042737-202204000-00001 10.1097/MEG.0000000000002299", "titl": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and risk of incident hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "mesh": "Adult;;; Female;;; Humans;;; *Hypertension/epidemiology;;; Male;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology;;; Risk Factors", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Ciardullo, Stefano; Grassi, Guido; Mancia, Giuseppe; Perseghin, Gianluca", "jour": "European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology", "affl": "Department of Medicine and Rehabilitation, Policlinico di Monza Hospital, Monza.;;; Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine and Surgery.;;; Department of Medicine and Surgery, Clinica medica, University of Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy.;;; Department of Medicine and Rehabilitation, Policlinico di Monza Hospital, Monza.;;; Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine and Surgery.;;; Department of Medicine and Rehabilitation, Policlinico di Monza Hospital, Monza.;;; Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Medicine and Surgery.", "pdat": "2022 Apr 1", "tiab": "Several studies reported an association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the risk of incident hypertension.

Measures of association from individual studies were meta-analyzed using random-effects models. Of the 1108 titles initially scrutinized, we included 11 cohort studies with data on 390 348 participants (52% male) and a mean follow-up of 5.7 years. In the overall analysis, NAFLD was associated with a moderately increased risk of incident hypertension (hazard ratio 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-2.01; test for overall effect z = 5.266; P < 0.001). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies (P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses showed that estimates were not affected by geographical location, duration of follow-up and adjustment for baseline blood pressure values. On the other hand, the magnitude of the association was lower in studies that adjusted for baseline adiposity compared with those that did not, explaining part of the observed heterogeneity. No significant publication bias was detected by funnel plot analysis and Egger's and Begg's tests.

Accordingly, in uni- (OR 1.12 95% CI 0.98-1.29; P=0.098) and multivariable analysis adjusting for different risk factors (aOR 0.96 95%CI 0.82-1.13; P=0.601) no independent association was found. On subgroup analysis, NAFLD diagnosed by TE was more prevalent in the Hp positive compared to the Hp negative group (49% vs. 38%, P=0.004) and these patients also had higher steatosis grades. However, after adjustment for risk factors, no independent association between Hp positivity and NAFLD diagnosed by TE (aOR 1.26 95%CI 0.89-1.78; P=0.194) was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: In this Central European cohort, Hp-positivity was not associated with the diagnosis of NAFLD.

Both hepatic and peripheral insulin resistances are strongly associated with NAFLD. We aimed to compare the predictive powers of a hepatic insulin resistance index, the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and a novel peripheral insulin resistance index, the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), for the prediction of prevalent and incident NAFLD. METHODS: Data from 8,360 adults aged 40-69 years at baseline and 5,438 adults without NAFLD who were followed-up at least once after the baseline survey in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were analyzed. The survey was performed biennially, up to the eighth follow-up. RESULTS: The predictive powers of the METS-IR and HOMA-IR for prevalent NAFLD were not significantly different (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [95% confidence interval]: METS-IR, 0.824 [0.814-0.834]; HOMAIR, 0.831 [0.821-0.842]; P=0.276). The area under the time-dependent ROC curve (Heagerty's integrated area under the curve) of the METS-IR for incident NAFLD was 0.683 (0.671-0.695), significantly higher than that of the HOMA-IR (0.551 [0.539-0.563], P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The METS-IR is superior to the HOMA-IR for the prediction of incident NAFLD and is not inferior to the HOMA-IR for the prediction of prevalent NAFLD.

The aim of the present study was to investigate different biochemical-based scores available and determine which one could best serve as an NAFLD predicting tool in a severely obese population. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving severely obese patients. All patients were evaluated with serum laboratory parameters for 1 week before biopsy, and all patients were treated with intraoperative liver biopsy, during bariatric surgery. RESULTS: A total of 143 severely obese patients were included. The median body mass index (BMI) was 48 kg/m2 (35-65). Diabetes mellitus was present in 36%, and steatosis was present in 93% (severe steatosis in 20%). Only aspartate transaminase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI=0.65 (95% CI: 0.55-0.8) and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR=0.7 (95% CI: 0.58-0.82) showed significant capacity for the prediction of severe steatosis.

CONCLUSIONS: NAFLDS, FIB-4, AST/ALT, and HSI have no utility for the evaluation of severe steatosis in severely obese patients. Diabetes and insulin-resistance-related biochemical assessments, such as HOMA-IR, can be used as good screening tools for severe steatosis in these patients.

The present cross-sectional study aims to investigate possible sex differences in the prevalence of FLI-defined NAFLD as well as in its association with common risk factors across different age groups, in a large sample of Spanish working adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included data from 33,216 Spanish adult workers (18-65 years) randomly selected during voluntary routine occupational medical examinations. Sociodemographic characteristics (age and social class), anthropometric (height, weight, and waist circumference) and clinical parameters (blood pressure and serum parameters) were collected. NAFLD was determined by the validated fatty liver index (FLI) with a cut-off value of >/= 60. The presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) was assessed according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Diabetes Federation. Cardiovascular risk was determined using the REGICOR-Framingham equation. The association between FLI-defined NAFLD and risk factors by sex and age was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of FLI-defined NAFLD (FLI >/= 60) was 19.1% overall, 27.9% (95% CI 23.3-28.5%) for men and 6.8% (95% CI 6.4-7.3%) for women and increasing across age intervals. As compared to women, men presented worse cardiometabolic and anthropometric profiles. The multivariate analysis model showed that hepatic steatosis assessed by FLI was strongly associated with age, HDL-cholesterol, social class, prediabetes, diabetes, prehypertension, hypertension, and smoking status for both men and women.

METHODS: The data of 93 participants from a tertiary hospital were assessed. Before laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and three months after LSG, anthropometric parameters, laboratory biochemical data, and abdominal B-ultrasound results were collected, and their hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) were calculated. A NAFLD improvement (NAFLD-I) nomogram prediction model was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multiple regression, and its predictive ability was verified in a validation cohort.

Meanwhile, obesity is a known predisposing factor for NAFLD. Nutrient-focused research can enhance the mechanistic understanding of dietary effects. We thus hypothesized that higher dietary fiber intake was associated with lower risk of NAFLD through the mediating role of obesity. METHODS: In this nationwide cross-sectional study, dietary fiber was surveyed using two 24-h recalls. NAFLD and clinically significant fibrosis (CSF) were determined by vibration-controlled transient elastography. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were applied to investigate the association of dietary fiber with NAFLD, CSF, and liver function parameters. We used counterfactual-based mediation analysis to estimate the direct and indirect effect of dietary fiber on NAFLD. RESULTS: Of the 3,974 participants, ~36.86% and 7.78% of participants were diagnosed with NAFLD and CSF. Compared with participants among the lowest tertile, the highest tertile of dietary fiber consumption was associated with lower odds of NAFLD (OR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.66-0.98; P (overall) = 0.019). Dietary fiber intake appeared to be linked with lower odds of CSF (OR (Tertile3vs.Tertile1) = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.58-1.14; P (overall) = 0.107). Mediation analysis showed that obesity fully mediated the association of dietary fiber with NAFLD. Dietary fiber was associated with improved hepatic parameters.

METHODS: A systematic review was performed following guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. A literature search of PubMed and Embase was performed in July of 2020 to identify studies that evaluated diagnostic characteristics of sequential NIT algorithms in NAFLD. RESULTS: Among 8 studies meeting inclusion criteria, 48 algorithms were studied in 6741 patients. The average sensitivity, specificity, positive PV, negative PV, and proportion of indeterminate values for included algorithms were 72%, 92%, 88%, 82%, and 25%, respectively. Six algorithms achieved sensitivities in the top quartile (>/=86.3%) with <25% indeterminate values. Four algorithms achieved specificities in the top quartile (>/=98.7%) with <25% indeterminate values. The aforementioned algorithms included combinations of Fibrosis-4, NAFLD fibrosis score, and vibration-controlled transient elastography. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential NIT algorithms may reduce indeterminate results while achieving sensitivities comparable to single NITs. Sequential algorithms may also augment the specificities of single NITs, though resulting positive PVs may not be high enough to obviate the need for liver biopsy.

Some studies have demonstrated that triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) showed an independent positive association with NAFLD. However, research on its diagnostic value in patients with suspected NAFLD is limited. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether TyG-BMI was accurate in detecting NAFLD in the general Japanese population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 14,280 individuals who underwent a comprehensive health examination was conducted. Standard protocols were followed to collect anthropometric measurements, lab data, and ultrasonography features. All participants were randomly stratified into the development group (n = 7118) and validation group (n = 7162). The TyG-BMI was calculated. Following this, the diagnostic value of the TyG-BMI was evaluated based on the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Two cutoff points were selected and used to rule out or rule in the NALFD, and the specificity, sensitivity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value were explored, respectively. In order to verify the stability of the results, external verification was performed. RESULTS: There were 1272 and 1243 NAFLD participants in the development and validation groups, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of TyG-BMI was 0.888 (95% CI 0.876-0.896) and 0.884 (95% CI 0.875-0.894) for the training and validation group, respectively. Using the low TyG-BMI (182.2) cutoff, NAFLD could be excluded with high accuracy (negative predictive value: 96.9% in estimation and 96.9% in validation). The presence of NAFLD could effectively be determined by applying the high cutoff of TyG-BMI (224.0), as the positive predictive value of the estimation and validation groups is 70.7% and 70.1%, respectively. As a result of applying this model, 9996 (70%) of the 14,280 participants would not have undergone ultrasonography, with an accurate prediction of 9308 (93.1%). AUC was 0.874 for external validation using 183,730 Chinese non-obese participants. TyG-BMI was demonstrated to be an excellent diagnostic tool by both internal and external validation.

METHODS: A total of 1595 community-dwelling people aged 70-84 years were followed for 2 years in the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study. Muscle mass was estimated by dividing appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) by body mass index (BMI). Muscle strength was measured as handgrip strength (HGS) divided by BMI. The sex-specific lowest quintiles of ASM/BMI and HGS/BMI of the study population were used as cutoffs for LMM and LMS, respectively. The risk of LMM and LMS were assessed according to hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and fatty liver index (FLI) quartiles. RESULTS: As HSI quartiles increased, the LMM risk increased gradually, after adjusting for age, sex, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, and several causative factors (insulin resistance, inflammation, and vitamin D) (Q4 vs. Q1 OR [95% CI] 3.46 [2.23-5.35]). The increased risk of LMS was even higher according to HSI quartiles (Q4 vs. Q1 5.81 [3.67-9.21]). Multivariate analyses based on FLI showed similar results. People with NAFLD (HSI > 36) were at higher risk of developing LMM and LMS compared to those without (1.65 [1.19-2.31] and 2.29 [1.61-3.26], respectively).

Insulin resistance is recognized as a common contributor to diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study aimed to investigate the association between a first-degree family history of diabetes (FHD) and NAFLD and the influence of glucose metabolic status. METHODS: The present work analyzed a part of the baseline data of the REACTION study conducted in a community population. A total of 11,162 participants with an average age of 55.57 +/- 9.66 years were enrolled, including 9870 non-FDRs and 1292 FDRs. First-degree FHD was defined as at least one patient with diabetes among parents, siblings or children. The fatty liver index (FLI) was calculated to identify NAFLD. RESULTS: The proportions of subjects without NAFLD, with intermediate FLI, and with NAFLD differed significantly between non-FDRs and FDRs (P < 0.001). FLI was one of the metabolic factors independently associated with first-degree FHD (P = 0.006). Multivariate variance analysis revealed positive associations of first-degree FHD and glucose metabolic status (both P < 0.001) with FLI, which were independent of each other (P for interaction = 0.182). Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis identified that first-degree FHD was independently and positively associated with FLI in men, premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A first-degree FHD was an independent risk factor for NAFLD.

We aimed to investigate the association of NAFLD development and remission with the risk of incident diabetes during a median of 3.5-year follow-up. METHODS: A total of 2690 participants without diabetes were recruited in 2011-2012 and assessed for incident diabetes in 2014. Abdominal ultrasonography was used to determine the change of NAFLD. 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed to determine diabetes. NAFLD severity was assessed using Gholam's model. The odds ratios (ORs) for incident diabetes were estimated by logistic regression models. RESULTS: NAFLD was developed in 580 (33.2%) participants and NAFLD remission occurred in 150 (15.9%) participants during a median of 3.5-year follow-up. A total of 484 participants developed diabetes during follow-up, including 170 (14.6%) in consistent non-NAFLD group, 111 (19.1%) in NAFLD developed group, 19 (12.7%) in NAFLD remission group, and 184 (23.2%) in sustained NAFLD group. The development of NAFLD increased the risk of incident diabetes by 43% (OR, 1.43; 95%CI, 1.10-1.86) after adjustment for multiple confounders. Compared with sustained NAFLD group, remission of NAFLD reduced the risk of incident diabetes by 52% (OR, 0.48; 95%CI, 0.29-0.80). The effect of NAFLD alteration on incident diabetes was not changed after adjustment for body mass index or waist circumference, change of body mass index or waist circumference. In NAFLD remission group, participants with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) at baseline were more likely to develop diabetes (OR, 3.03; 95%CI, 1.01-9.12). CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD development increases the risk of incident diabetes, whereas NAFLD remission reduces the risk of incident diabetes.

Its all-cause mortality is often driven by co-existing metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM), which share many pathophysiological characteristics. The risk of developing T2DM among NAFLD patients in Germany is only poorly described. METHODS: A cohort of 17 245 NAFLD patients and a propensity score-matched cohort of equal size were identified from the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) between 2005 and 2020. The incidence of T2DM was evaluated as a function of NAFLD during a 5-year study period using Cox-regression models. RESULTS: Within 5 years of the index date, 18.8% and 11.7% of individuals with and without NAFLD were diagnosed with T2DM ( P  < 0.001). Regression analysis revealed a hazard ratio of 1.77 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.68-1.88] for the development of T2DM among NAFLD patients.

Although liver biopsy has been considered the \"gold standard\" method for evaluating the degree of liver fibrosis, it is not suitable for extensive use in all patients with NAFLD owing to its invasiveness and high cost. Therefore, noninvasive biochemical and imaging biomarkers have been developed to overcome the limitations of liver biopsy. Imaging biomarkers for the stratification of liver fibrosis have been evaluated in patients with NAFLD using different imaging techniques, such as transient elastography, shear wave elastography, and magnetic resonance elastography. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and deep learning methods are increasingly being applied to improve the diagnostic accuracy of imaging techniques and overcome the pitfalls of existing imaging biomarkers.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a nationally representative population of 4189 US adults aged 20-80 years. A FibroScan(R) 502 V2 device (Echosens) was used to estimate the CAP and LSM. Liver markers, including the aspartate transaminase (AST) to alanine transaminase (ALT) ratio, fatty liver index (FLI) and fibrosis-4 score, were also calculated. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was calculated using a 24-h diet recall. RESULTS: Lower DII scores (anti-inflammatory diet) were associated with a lower AST:ALT ratio (p < 0.001) and FLI (p < 0.036) after adjusting for covariates. Linear regression analysis revealed that gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (beta = 1.702, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.325-3.080, p = 0.015), ALT levels (beta = -0.616, 95% CI = -1.097 to -0.135, p = 0.012), AST:ALT ratio (beta = 0.025, 95% CI = 0.014-0.036, p < 0.001) and FLI (beta = 1.168, 95% CI = 0.224-2.112, p = 0.015) were significantly associated with the DII in the multivariable-adjusted model. Participants in the highest anti-inflammatory tertile had the lowest odds ratio (OR) for NAFLD assessed by FLI in both unadjusted (OR = 0.652, 95% CI = 0.539-0.788, p </= 0.001) and adjusted models (OR = 0.722, 95% CI = 0.537-0.972, p = 0.032). For the transient elastography parameters (LSM and CAP), no significant associations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: There was no relationship between the transient elastography parameters and the anti-inflammatory diet profile, although our study showed an association between higher pro-inflammatory properties of diet and poorer hepatic health assessed by surrogate markers of liver disease.

Bicyclol has protective activity against NAFLD in mice; however, the effect of bicyclol on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NASH and its underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown particularly anti-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagic machinery potentials. Therefore, the present study was performed to investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanisms of bicyclol action on NAFLD/NASH. METHODS: Mice were fed an HFD to induce NAFLD/NASH, and bicyclol was administered as a treatment. Biochemistry and histopathological assays were performed to evaluate the effects of bicyclol on NAFLD/NASH. Moreover, the levels of hepatic ER stress- and autophagy-related markers were determined by western blotting. RESULTS: The present results revealed that bicyclol exerted significant protective effects against HFD-induced NAFLD/NASH. This activity was evidenced by the decrease in elevated serum transaminase and hepatic triglyceride levels, and the attenuation of negative histopathological changes. Bicyclol considerably alleviated hepatic inflammation and apoptosis.

An umbrella review of meta-analyses was performed to summarize the quality of evidence regarding the epidemiologic associations between lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in regards to risk and treatment. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Embase Database from inception until June 1, 2021. Meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the associations of lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome with NAFLD risk or treatment were screened. We assessed meta-analyses of observational studies based on random-effect summary effect sizes and their P values, 95% prediction intervals, heterogeneity, and small-study effects. For meta-analyses of RCTs, outcomes with a random-effect P < 0.005 and a high-GRADE assessment were classified as strong evidence. RESULTS: A total of 37 publications were included in this review: twenty-two publications reporting 41 meta-analyses of observational studies (37 unique outcomes) and 15 publications reporting 81 meta-analyses of RCTs (63 unique outcomes) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was high for 97% of the included meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was rated high only for the association of sugar-sweetened soda consumption with increased NAFLD risk in meta-analyses of observational studies. Only 3 therapeutic interventions (green tea improving ALT, TG, TC and LDL, omega-3 PUFAs improving HOMR-IR and plasma glucose, and exercise improving RT and ALT) from meta -analyses of RCTs with suggestive (change to high/low/etc) levels of evidence were identified.

Mice with NAFLD were treated with or without sesamolin. Sesamolin effectively suppressed obesity-associated metabolic disorder, attenuated hepatic steatosis and the infiltration of inflammatory cells, and decreased levels of hepatic proinflammatory cytokines. Sesamolin also altered the composition of gut microbiota at the genus level. Additionally, differential serum metabolite biomarkers identified in an untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that sesamolin changed the levels of metabolites and influenced metabolomics pathways including caffeine metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and cysteine and methionine metabolism. Changes in metabolite biomarkers and the abundances of Faecalibaculum, Lachnoclostridium, Mucispirillum, Allobaculum, and Bacteroides are highly correlated with those factors involved in the progression of NAFLD. These results are important in deciphering new mechanisms by which changes in bacteria and metabolites in sesamolin treatment might be associated with the alleviation of obesity-associated NAFLD in HF-HF diet-fed mice.

RESULTS: The results showed that 527 (29.9%) subjects suffered from NAFLD, the TyG index was associated with NAFLD (OR=5.456, 95% CI [3.526~8.442]), and the CDKAL1 gene rs10946398 SNP has a relationship with NAFLD (OR=1.509, 95% CI [1.046~2.178]). The distribution of the C allele of rs10946398 was statistically significant at different levels of the TyG index.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of dietary pattern modification on the association between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A large prospective cohort study (n = 24,602) was conducted in China. NAFLD was diagnosed using liver ultrasonography considering alcohol consumption. Dietary data were assessed using a validated self-administered food frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Following a 93,873 person-year follow-up, 787 (3.20%) participants developed type 2 diabetes. In a multivariable adjusted model, compared with participants without NAFLD, the HR (95% CI) of incident type 2 diabetes for NAFLD patients was 3.04 (2.51, 3.68). On subgroup analyses, the adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of incident type 2 diabetes for NAFLD patients with low (</=median score) and high (>median score) vegetable pattern intakes were 4.08 (3.05, 5.46) and 2.38 (1.85, 3.07) (p for interaction <0.01), respectively. Higher vegetable intake was also found to attenuate the risk effect of phenotype groups of NAFLD on incident type 2 diabetes, especially in the lean NAFLD group.

Accumulating evidence indicates that neutrophils driving insulin resistance (IR), including hepatic IR, precipitate T2D-associated NAFLD/NASH. We hypothesized that targeting neutrophil accumulation into insulin-sensitive tissues in mice using a CXCR2 antagonist under T2D-precipitating high fat diet (HFD) could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent the progression towards liver pathology reminiscent of NAFLD/NASH. METHODS: Mice were age-matched and on standard rodent chow prior to 1:1 randomization into control and HFD formulated with the CXCR2 antagonist AZD5069 or with biologically inactive substitute. They were monitored for metabolic changes including insulin sensitivity using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and hepatic histopathologic evaluation in H&E-stained sections as well as via immunofluorescence microscopy of liver sections for leukocyte markers, collagen 1A1 formation, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), and galectin-3 expression, for 16 weeks. Statistical tests used to determine significant differences among study groups and outcomes include Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA, repeated measures two-way ANOVA, and Fisher's exact test, depending on the analytical question. RESULTS: Compared to mice on HFD, mice in the AZD5069-formulated HFD exhibited improved insulin sensitivity, a modest reduction in weight gain, and a significant improvement in LP and markers related to NAFLD/NASH. Mice in the AZD5069-formulated HFD also exhibited reduced neutrophil accumulation into the liver at the end of the 16 week study period. CONCLUSIONS: These results show, for the first time, the effectiveness of a selective CXCR2 antagonist to improve insulin sensitivity, concomitantly preventing the progression towards LP characteristic of NAFLD/NASH. This represents a novel approach to target IR and developing LP under T2D-susceptible conditions using a single agent.

The aim of the review is to explore the association between NAFLD and cognitive function. METHODS: Using the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic electronic literature search was conducted in four databases: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase and CINAHL from inception until March 2021. Neuropsychological tests utilised within each study were grouped into relevant cognitive domains including 'general cognition', 'reasoning', 'mental speed, attention and psychomotor speed', 'memory and learning', 'language', 'visuospatial perception' and 'ideas, abstraction, figural creations and mental flexibility'. RESULTS: Eleven observational studies that involved 7978 participants with a mean age of 51 years were included. Those with NAFLD had poor cognitive performance in three cognitive domains, including 'general cognition', 'mental speed, attention and psychomotor speed', and 'ideas, abstraction, figural creations and mental flexibility'. CONCLUSION: The observed results from the 11 included studies showed that NAFLD was associated with lower cognitive performance across several domains.

Whether this association is due to WHtR itself or mediated by WHtR-associated increases in triglyceride (TG) is uncertain. On that account, our research aims to disentangle these relationships. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 14251 participants who participated in the medical examination program were consecutively and non-selectively collected in Murakami Memorial Hospital in Japan from 2004 to 2015. The independent and dependent variables were WHtR and NAFLD, respectively. Triglyceride was the mediating factor. The correlation between WHtR, TG, and NAFLD risk factors was examined using spearman correlation analysis. The association between WHtR or TG and NAFLD was examined using multiple logistic regression. In order to determine whether TG mediated the association between WHtR and NAFLD, a mediation analysis was performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the included individuals was 43.53 +/- 8.89 years old, and 7411 (52.00%) were male. The mean WHtR and TG were 0.46 +/- 0.05, 0.89 +/- 0.63, respectively. The prevalence rate of NAFLD was 2507 (17.59%). Individuals with NAFLD had significantly higher levels of WHtR and TG than those without NAFLD (P&lt;0.05). After adjusting covariates, the multivariate linear regression analysis showed that WHtR was positively associated with TG. That was, for every 0.1 increase in WHtR, TG increased by 0.226mmol/L (beta=0.226, 95%CI: 0.206, 0.247). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that WHtR (OR=8.743, 95%CI: 7.528, 10.153) and TG (OR=1.897, 95%CI: 1.732, 2.078) were positively associated with NAFLD. The mediation analysis showed that WHtR had a direct, significant effect on NAFLD (beta=0.139, 95%CI: 0.126, 0.148), and TG partially mediated the indirect effect of WHtR on NAFLD (beta=0.016, 95% CI: 0.013-0.019).

However, the effects of ADF on preventing diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and related cognitive deficits are still elusive. In the present study, a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mouse model was established. Mice were treated with a 4-week long ADF regimen and/or switching the diet to a standard diet. ADF reduced lipid accumulation, activated AMPK/ULK1 signaling, and suppressed the phosphorylation of mTOR. Also, ADF inhibited lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in the white adipose tissue and down-regulated expressions of PPAR-gamma and cytokines. Moreover, ADF improved the working memory and synaptic structure in the DIO mice and upregulated PSD-95 and BDNF in the hippocampus. ADF reduced oxidative stress and microglial over-activation in the CNS.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of electronic health record data from a primary care clinic identified patients with diagnoses of NAFLD from 2012 through 2021. Patients with a diagnosis of a severe liver disease outcome during the study period were excluded. The most recent FIB-4 and NFS scores were calculated and categorized by advanced fibrosis risk. Charts were reviewed to identify the outcome of a confirmatory fibrosis risk assessment by liver elastography or liver biopsy for all patients with indeterminate-risk or higher FIB-4 (>/= 1.3) and NFS (>/= - 1.455) scores. RESULTS: The cohort included 604 patients diagnosed with NAFLD. Two-thirds of included patients (399) had a FIB-4 or NFS score greater than low-risk, 19% (113) had a high-risk FIB-4 (>/= 2.67) or NFS (>/= 0.676) score, and 7% (44) had high-risk FIB-4 and NFS values.

A considerable proportion of patients with MO have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Hence, non-invasive assessment is critical in this group of patients. OBJECTIVES: To report NAFLD/NASH prevalence in a cohort of patients with MO and to identify predictors of NASH. METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients subjected to bariatric surgery in a University hospital in Spain underwent LB. Anthropometric, clinical and biochemical variables were registered. According of the results of the LB, individuals were classified by whether they had NASH or not. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent factors associated with NASH. RESULTS: NAFLD was reported in 94.2% of the patients, simple steatosis was present in 51.92% and NASH in 42.31%. Meanwhile, 17.3% of patients exhibited significant fibrosis (>/=F2). HIGHT score for NASH risk was established using five independent predictors: systemic Hypertension, Insulin resistance, Gamma-glutamyl transferase, High density lipoprotein cholesterol and alanine Transaminase. This score ranges from 0 to 7 and was used to predict NASH in our cohort (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve 0.846). A score of 4 or greater implied high risk (sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 73.3%, positive predictive value 68%, negative predictive value 81.5%, accuracy 75%).

In addition, overlapping features with the diseases of the metabolic syndrome, combined with heterogeneity in disease mechanisms, further complicates NAFLD diagnosis and prognosis, and hampers progress in biomarker and pharmacological discoveries. Here, we explore solving the heterogeneous clinical landscape of NAFLD by cluster analysis of molecular signatures that serve as a proxy for disease stratification into molecular sub-types. First, we collected information on NAFLD and metabolic syndrome-associated protein-coding genes by data mining the literature. Next, we performed pathways enrichment and cluster analyses to decipher and dissect the different patterns of phenotypic heterogeneity. Our approach showed unique biological pathways for every clinical subtype/group, namely NAFLD + obesity, NAFLD + arterial hypertension, NAFLD + dyslipidemia, and NAFLD + type 2 diabetes.

RESULTS: A total of 1257 nonobese adults (625 non-NAFLD and 632 nonobese NAFLD) with body mass index (BMI) 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) were enrolled in the study. And all patients were divided into homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA - IR) > 1 group and HOMA - IR </= 1 group. When all the variables were adjusted in both the HOMA - IR > 1 group and HOMA - IR </= 1 group, older age (>50 years), higher BMI (23.0-24.9 kg/m(2)), higher AST (>18 U/L), higher TG (>0.9 mmol/L), higher GLU (>5.25 mmol/L), and higher HbA1C (>5.5%) were associated with higher risks of nonobese NAFLD. In patients with HOMA - IR > 1, lower homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) (<47.1%) (OR, 7.460, 95% CI, 3.051-18.238, P < 0.001) was associated with higher risks of nonobese NAFLD. CONCLUSION: s. Metabolic profiles (i.e., higher BMI, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and higher glycosylated hemoglobin) are risk factors of nonobese NAFLD, regardless of insulin resistance status. Decreased function of pancreatic beta-cells may be the risk factor of nonobese NAFLD with insulin resistance, who should pay attention to further development of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36568964/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1155/2022/9060405", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 35745284, "aid": "nu14122554 nutrients-14-02554 10.3390/nu14122554", "titl": "Relation of Dietary Patterns and Nutritional Profile to Hepatic Fibrosis in a Sample of Lebanese Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Patients.", "mesh": "Cross-Sectional Studies;;; Diet/adverse effects;;; Humans;;; Liver Cirrhosis/complications;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/epidemiology/etiology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Sayegh, Nicole Fakhoury; Heraoui, Gessica N H A; Younes, Hassan; Sayegh, Lea Nicole; Boulos, Christa; Sayegh, Raymond", "jour": "Nutrients", "affl": "Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Pharmacy, Saint Joseph University, Damascus Road, Riad el Solh, Beirut P.O.

In the present study we analyzed, if this is reflected in clinical routine for advanced diagnostic measures. METHODS: Retrospective data of 93 patients with histologically determined fibrosis stage and confirmed etiology was analyzed. Patients were grouped according to chronic liver disease alone (n=40), concomitant chronic liver disease and NAFLD (n=29), or NAFLD alone (n=24). Fibrosis stage and presence of cirrhosis were main outcome measures. RESULTS: Patients with NAFLD were significantly older and had significantly higher body mass index and CAP-values than patients with chronic liver disease. Significantly higher fibrosis stages were observed in patients with NAFLD than in those with chronic liver disease alone (p=0.003). Presence of cirrhosis was significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than in patients with chronic liver disease (p=0.01). This was not associated with a significantly different age distribution over fibrosis stages between chronic liver disease and NAFLD. Undergoing liver biopsy 10 years earlier could have possibly prevented progression to cirrhosis in up to 7 patients with NAFLD. This could have potentially saved 35,000 euro yearly health care resources. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the time course for development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis is not fundamentally different between patients with NAFLD or with other chronic liver diseases.

While existing studies have examined cardiac remodeling in NAFLD, there has been less emphasis on the development of carotid atherosclerosis and stroke. We sought to conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the prevalence, risk factors, and degree of risk increment of carotid atherosclerosis and stroke in NAFLD. METHODS: Embase and Medline were searched for articles relating to NAFLD, carotid atherosclerosis, and stroke. Proportional data was analysed using a generalized linear mixed model. Pairwise meta-analysis was conducted to obtain odds ratio or weighted mean difference for comparison between patients with and without NAFLD. RESULTS: From pooled analysis of 30 studies involving 7,951 patients with NAFLD, 35.02% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.36-43.53%) had carotid atherosclerosis with an odds ratio of 3.20 (95% CI, 2.37-4.32; P<0.0001). Pooled analysis of 25,839 patients with NAFLD found the prevalence of stroke to be 5.04% (95% CI, 2.74-9.09%) with an odds ratio of 1.88 (95% CI, 1.23-2.88; P=0.02) compared to non-NAFLD. The degree of steatosis assessed by ultrasonography in NAFLD was closely associated with risk of carotid atherosclerosis and stroke. Older age significantly increased the risk of developing carotid atherosclerosis, but not stroke in NAFLD. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that a stepwise increment of steatosis of NAFLD can significantly increase the risk of carotid atherosclerosis and stroke development in NAFLD.

Whether NAFLD carries a more benign course in younger adults is not known. We aimed to characterize genetic and metabolic risk factors for NAFLD and their effects on disease progression across age groups. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of adults with NAFLD seen within Michigan Medicine, a tertiary care center, between 2010 and 2021. NAFLD was defined by hepatic steatosis on imaging, biopsy, or transient elastography in the absence of other chronic liver diseases. Cirrhosis was determined by validated International Classification of Diseases-9/10 codes or imaging. Fine-Gray competing risk models were generated, with incident cirrhosis and liver-related events (LREs) as the primary outcomes and death without cirrhosis or LREs as a competing risk. The primary predictor was the age category. RESULTS: We included 31,505 patients with NAFLD, with 8,252 aged 18 to younger than 40, 15,035 aged 40 to younger than 60, and 8,218 aged 60 years or older years at diagnosis. Compared with older patients, young adults more often had obesity, higher ALT, and high-risk PNPLA3 alleles, and fewer had prevalent cirrhosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. The 10-year risk of incident cirrhosis was similar between ages (3.4% in age 18 to <40 vs 3.7% in age 40 to <60 vs 4.7% in age >/=60; p = 0.058).

Furthermore, it is not evident which modality of exercise is optimal to improve/attenuate NAFLD. OBJECTIVES: The aim is to systematically review evidence for the effect of aerobic exercise (AE) on NAFLD, in particular non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline and Embase. Studies were screened and included according to predefined criteria, data were extracted, and the quality was assessed by Cochrane risk of bias tools by two researchers independently according to the protocol registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021270059). Meta-analyses were performed using a bivariate random-effects model when there were at least three randomized intervention studies (RCTs) with similar intervention modalities and outcome. RESULTS: The systematic review process resulted in an inclusion a total of 24 studies, 18 RCTs and six non-RCTs, encompassing 1014 patients with NAFLD diagnosed by histological or radiological findings. Studies were grouped based on the type of AE: moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). A total of twelve meta-analyses were conducted. Compared to controls, MICT resulted in a mean difference (MD) in the NAFLD biomarkers alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of -3.59 (CI: -5.60, -1.59, p<0.001) and -4.05 (CI: -6.39, -1.71, p<0.001), respectively. HIIT resulted in a MD of -4.31 (95% CI: -9.03, 0.41, p=0.07) and 1.02 (95% CI: -6.91, 8.94, p=0.8) for ALT and AST, respectively. Moreover, both AE types compared to controls showed a significantly lower magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) determined liver fat with a MD of -5.19 (95% CI: -7.33, -3.04, p<0.001) and -3.41 (95% CI: -4.74, -2.08, p<0.001), for MICT and HIIT respectively. MICT compared to controls resulted in a significantly higher cardiorespiratory fitness (MD: 4.43, 95% CI: 0.31, 8.55, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Liver fat is decreased by AE with a concomitant decrease of liver enzymes. AE improved cardiorespiratory fitness. Further studies are needed to elucidate the impact of different types of AE on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.

RESULTS: Considering the etiological agents that acts on NAFLD development and progression, the genetics and the epigenetics emerged as relevant factors. Genetics acts as a powerful element in the establishment and progression of the NAFLD.

Although there is no first-line drug approved for the treatment of NAFLD, polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC) is used by clinicians to treat NAFLD patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PPC on a mice model of NAFLD, and to study the PPC's mechanism of action. The mice were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet to induce NAFLD and were subsequently treated with PPC. The treatment effects were evaluated by the liver index, histopathological examination, and routine blood chemistry analyses. Lipidomics and metabolomics analyses of 54 samples were carried out using ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a mass spectrometer to select for changes in metabolites associated with CDAA diet-induced NAFLD and the effects of PPC treatment. The intestinal flora of mice were extracted for gene sequencing to find differences before and after the induction of NAFLD and PPC treatment. PPC significantly improved the CDAA diet-induced NAFLD condition in mice. A total of 19 metabolites including 5 polar metabolites and 14 lipids showed marked changes.

This article discusses recent data concerning the use of dietary polyphenols in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD in vitro, in vivo, and in clinical trials. METHODS: Study searches were performed using the PubMed database from the National Library of Medicine-National Institutes of Health. RESULTS: Polyphenols exert beneficial effects in NAFLD, with positive outcomes being related to body weight gain, insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation, oxidative stress, proinflammatory status, mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. Data reported for hydroxytyrosol suggest that the activation of the hepatic PPAR-alpha-FGF21-AMPK-PGC-1alpha signaling cascade is associated with fatty acid oxidation enhancement, de novo lipogenesis diminution and recovery of mitochondrial function, a contention that is supported by the actions of several polyphenols on specific components of this signaling pathway. Besides, polyphenols downregulate NF-kappaB, suppressing the pro-inflammatory state developed in NAFLD and upregulate liver Nrf2, increasing the cellular antioxidant potential. The latter feature of polyphenols is contributed by chelation of pro-oxidant trace elements, reduction of free radicals to stable forms and inhibition of free radical generating systems. CONCLUSION: Polyphenols are relevant bioactive compounds in terms of prevention and treatment of NAFLD, which exhibit low bioavailability and instability in biological systems that could limit their health effects.

Preclinical studies have suggested that FGF21 induction exerts a protective effect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), while human studies have revealed elevated levels of and potential resistance to FGF21 in patients with NAFLD. However, whether the FGF21 pathway also contributes to NAFLD risk at the genetic level remains uncertain. A few attempts to investigate the impact of individual genetic variants at the loci encoding FGF21 and its receptors on NAFLD risk have failed to establish a clear association due to a limited effect size. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) develop a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for FGF21-related loci that are associated with NAFLD risk and (2) investigate the effect of its interaction with protein intake level on NAFLD risk. Data on 3501 participants of the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study (Ansan-Ansung) were analyzed. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms of fibroblast growth factor receptors and beta-klotho were selected for PHS determination using forward stepwise analysis. The association between the PHS and NAFLD was validated (p-trend: 0.0171 for men and <0.0001 for women). Moreover, the association was significantly modulated by the protein intake level in all participants as well as women (p-interaction = 0.0189 and 0.0131, respectively) but not in men. In particular, the women with the lowest PHS values and a protein intake lower than the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) exhibited a greater NAFLD risk (HR = 2.021, p-trend = 0.0016) than those with an intake equal to or greater than the RNI; however, those with higher PHS values had a high risk, regardless of protein intake level.

This study was to identify immune-cell-related biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: First, we introduced human liver transcriptome data from the GEO database (GSE48452 and GSE126848) and performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to screen out the modules related to immune cell infiltration and to identify immune-cell-related differentially expressed genes (ICR-DEGs) associated with NAFLD progression. Further, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of ICR-DEGs was established to obtain hub genes and subsequently, the expression trend analysis was conducted to identify immune-cell-related biomarkers of NAFLD. Finally, the mRNA expression of biomarkers was validated in a NAFLD mouse model induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. In total, we identified 66 ICR-DEGs and 13 hub genes associated with NAFLD. Among them, 9 hub genes (CD247, CD74, FCGR2B, IL2RB, INPP5D, MRPL16, RPL35, RPS3A, RPS8) were correlated with the infiltrating immune cells by the Pearson correlation analysis. Subsequently, 4 immune-cell-related biomarkers (RPL35, RPS3A, RPS8, and MRPL16) with the same expression trends in GSE48452 and GSE126848 datasets were identified. These biomarkers were enriched in immune-related pathways and had a good ability to distinguish between NASH and healthy samples. Moreover, we constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of biomarkers and predicted twenty potential therapeutic drugs targeting RPS3A such as taxifolin and sitagliptin. Finally, experimental validation indicated that the hepatic mRNA expression of Rpl35, Rps3A, and Rps8 was significantly decreased in NAFLD mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified four ribosomal protein genes (RPL35, RPS3A, RPS8, and MRPL16) as immune-cell-related biomarkers of NAFLD, which may actively participate in the immune processes during NAFLD progression and could serve as potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37274336/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fendo.2023.1161269", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland"}, {"uid": 35807929, "aid": "nu14132749 nutrients-14-02749 10.3390/nu14132749", "titl": "GOS Ameliorates Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Induced by High Fat and High Sugar Diet through Lipid Metabolism and Intestinal Microbes.", "mesh": "Animals;;; Cholesterol/metabolism;;; Diet, High-Fat/adverse effects;;; Lipid Metabolism;;; Liver/metabolism;;; Mice;;; Mice, Inbred C57BL;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism;;; Sugars/metabolism", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Qiu, Shuting; Chen, Jiajia; Bai, Yan; He, Jincan; Cao, Hua; Che, Qishi; Guo, Jiao; Su, Zhengquan", "jour": "Nutrients", "affl": "Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Natural Products and New Drugs, Guangdong Provincial University Engineering Technology Research Center of Natural Products and Drugs, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.;;; Guangdong Metabolic Disease Research Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Key Laboratory of Glucolipid Metabolic Disorder, Ministry of Education of China, Guangdong TCM Key Laboratory for Metabolic Diseases, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.;;; Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Natural Products and New Drugs, Guangdong Provincial University Engineering Technology Research Center of Natural Products and Drugs, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.;;; Guangdong Metabolic Disease Research Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Key Laboratory of Glucolipid Metabolic Disorder, Ministry of Education of China, Guangdong TCM Key Laboratory for Metabolic Diseases, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.;;; School of Public Health, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510310, China.;;; School of Public Health, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510310, China.;;; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Zhongshan 528458, China.;;; Guangzhou Rainhome Pharm & Tech Co., Ltd., Science City, Guangzhou 510663, China.;;; Guangdong Metabolic Disease Research Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Key Laboratory of Glucolipid Metabolic Disorder, Ministry of Education of China, Guangdong TCM Key Laboratory for Metabolic Diseases, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.;;; Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Natural Products and New Drugs, Guangdong Provincial University Engineering Technology Research Center of Natural Products and Drugs, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.;;; Guangdong Metabolic Disease Research Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Key Laboratory of Glucolipid Metabolic Disorder, Ministry of Education of China, Guangdong TCM Key Laboratory for Metabolic Diseases, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.", "pdat": "2022 Jul 1", "tiab": "The treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains very challenging.

Strategies are needed to identify high risk groups for NAFLD to improve screening approaches. Moreover, there is a lack of information about the prevalence of NAFLD on patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and the influence of NAFLD on the prognosis of the stroke. The aim of the study was to define the prevalence of NAFLD in patients with a first episode of AIS and the secondary aims were to evaluate the prevalence of NAFLD at different ages and its impact on the severity and prognosis of the AIS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational study including consecutive patients admitted for the first AIS from January 2005 to May 2018. Patients with harmful alcohol intake, other liver diseases and malignancies were excluded. Sociodemographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and blood test at admission were reviewed. NAFLD and liver fibrosis were assessed with the serological scores Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and Fibrosis-4 respectively. NAFLD was defined by a FLI>60. Stroke severity and prognosis were evaluated with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale respectively in patients aged from 40 to 79 years old. RESULTS: We included 1601 patients, 52.4% were female and median (IQR) age of 77 (66 - 83) years. The 41% of the total cohort had a FLI>60 with different prevalence according to age in decades: in 30-39 years: 35.7%; in 40-49: 47.5%; in 50-59: 51.1%, in 60-69: 56%, in 70-79: 41.4%; in 80-89: 34.9% (p<0.001).

Dietary behavior (DB) and health knowledge are crucial factors in the conceptual NAFLD model, which can directly influence this disease. These two factors largely align with the concept of food literacy (FL), which deals with proficiency in food-related skills and knowledge to promote healthy DB and prevent NAFLD. However, the potential of FL for NAFLD prevention remains unknown, because FL has not been tested in connection with DB and NAFLD. Therefore, the current study examined the direct and indirect connections between FL, DB, and NAFLD in a mediation model. (2) Methods: A total of 372 working adults (38% female) participated in a cross-sectional study by completing self-report questionnaires on FL and DB. In addition, an independent physician assessed the fatty-liver index (FLI) as an indicator of NAFLD in an occupational health checkup. (3) Results: The mediation model revealed that FL had a direct moderate connection with DB (beta = 0.25, p < 0.01), but no direct connection with the FLI (beta = -0.05, p = 0.36). However, DB showed a small to moderate connection with the FLI (beta = -0.14, p = 0.01), which could indicate the indirect-only mediation of the relationship between FL and NAFLD via DB. (4) Conclusion: These results confirm the value of DB for the prevention of NAFLD. In addition, FL might be a vital component for improving DB and thereby function as a resource in the prevention of NAFLD.

This pilot study evaluated VCTE, FAST-score, and LiMAx in NAFLD patients. METHODS: NAFLD patients prospectively underwent VCTE and LiMAx. The cutoffs for high fibrosis risk were 9.3/9.6 kPa (M/XL-probe) and 331 dB/m for steatosis. A FAST-score greater than 0.67 was used to identify patients with NASH and LiMAx values below 315 mug/kg/h for impaired liver function. RESULTS: In total, 57 NAFLD patients (BMI 32 +/- 6 kg/m2; 60% diabetes) were included. High risk for fibrosis and steatosis was observed in 26/57 and 28/57 cases, respectively.

We aimed to analyze the mediating effect of VAI on the FT3/FT4 ratio and NAFLD risk in the euthyroid population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 7 946 annual health examinees from the Health Examination Center, Hebei General Hospital, from January to December 2020. The basic information and biochemical parameters, as well as calculated FT3/FT4 ratio and VAI were collected. NAFLD was diagnosed according to abdominal ultrasonography. The fibrosis score for NAFLD positive subjects (NFS) was calculated to reflect the extent of liver fibrosis. The risk of NAFLD was analyzed by quartiles of FT3/FT4 ratio (Q1-Q4 quartiles) and VAI (V1-V4 quartiles), respectively. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between FT3/FT4 ratio and VAI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to analyze the effect of FT3/FT4 ratio and VAI on NAFLD and NFS status. Bootstrap was conducted to explore whether VAI mediated the association between FT3/FT4 ratio and NAFLD. RESULTS: Of the 7 946 participants, 2 810 (35.36%) had NAFLD and 5 136 (64.64%) did not. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that FT3/FT4 ratio was positively associated with VAI (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that compared to the Q1 group, the risk of NAFLD significantly increased in Q3 group [OR=1.255, 95%CI (1.011, 1.559)] and Q4 group [OR=1.553, 95%CI (1.252, 1.926)](P<0.05).

METHODS: Overall, 231 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were included. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient in a sub-group of 70 participants, in whom liver stiffness measurement (LSM) was performed by an elastography expert and an ultrasound expert who was an elastography trainee on the same day. RESULTS: Valid LSMs were obtained for 227, 220, 204, and 201 patients using MRE, VCTE, 2D-SWE, and all three modalities combined, respectively. Although the area under the curve did not differ between the modalities for detecting stage >/=1, >/=2, and >/=3 liver fibrosis, it was higher for MRE than VCTE and 2D-SWE for stage 4. Sex was a significant predictor of discordance between VCTE and liver fibrosis stage. Skin-capsule distance and the ratio of the interquartile range of liver stiffness to the median were significantly associated with discordance between 2D-SWE and liver fibrosis stage. However, no factors were associated with discordance between MRE and liver fibrosis stage. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility in detecting liver fibrosis was higher for MRE than VCTE and 2D-SWE. CONCLUSIONS: MRE, VCTE, and 2D-SWE demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy in detecting liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.

Admittedly, NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and severe fibrosis. Direct evidence of the fibrotic effect of NAFLD or NASH in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains lacking. We aimed to reveal the influence of concurrent histologically proven fatty liver diseases in fibrogenesis with chronic HBV infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study on a liver biopsy population of CHB patients without excessive alcohol intake to evaluate the prevalence of concurrent histologically proven NAFLD or NASH according to the fatty liver inhibition of progression (FLIP) algorithm and its association with the liver fibrosis stage. RESULTS: Among 1,081 CHB patients, concurrent NAFLD was found in 404 patients (37.4%), among whom 24.0% (97/404) have NASH. The presence of NASH was an independent predictor of significant fibrosis (odds ratio (OR), 2.53; 95% CI, 1.52-4.21; p < 0.001) and severe fibrosis (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.09-3.09; p = 0.023) in all patients, as well as in patients with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (predicting significant fibrosis, OR, 2.86, 95% CI, 1.34-6.10; p = 0.007). The presence of lobular inflammation (p < 0.001) or presence of cytological ballooning (p < 0.001), rather than presence of steatosis (p = 0.419), was related with severity of fibrosis in Spearman's correlation analysis.

The MAFLD added the criteria for defining metabolic dysfunctions, which are high-risk factors for liver-related and cardiovascular events. Contrary to the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) definition, it allows the coexistence of MAFLD and significant alcohol use in the same patient. AIM: To review the existing data that evaluate the clinical profile and long-term outcome difference between the patients identified as MAFLD and NAFLD. METHODS: Databases MEDLINE via PubMed and EMBASE were searched and relevant publications up to June 28, 2022 were assessed. Studies were included if they involved human participants diagnosed with MAFLD. RESULTS: A total of 2324 records were reviewed, of which 1575 duplicate citations were removed. Of the 2324 records screened, 207 articles were excluded, and 542 articles were assessed for their eligibility, for which 511 were excluded. The remaining 31 articles were selected for review. MAFLD diagnostic criteria were able to identify more individuals with fatty liver. Studies have shown that patients included using the MAFLD criteria were associated with higher risks of hepatic fibrosis when compared to NAFLD. All-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease-related, and cancer-related mortality were shown to be higher in MAFLD patients. MAFLD patients also had higher baseline metabolic derangement, and risks of developing obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular events. Of the 3 subtypes, diabetes mellitus has the strongest association with negative outcomes, followed by metabolic dysfunction and elevated body mass index. Within the subtypes of MAFLD, patients with more metabolic conditions at the time of diagnosis had worse hepatic and liver injury compared to those with a single metabolic condition. CONCLUSION: MAFLD is a new definition of fatty liver disease that is gaining increasing acceptance.

While most NAFLD patients are asymptomatic, NAFLD may progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Research reports, with daunting results, show the challenge that NAFLD's burden causes to global population health. The current process for identifying fibrosis risk levels is inefficient, expensive, does not cover all potential populations, and does not identify the risk in time. Instead of invasive liver biopsies, we implemented a non-invasive fibrosis assessment process calculated from clinical data (accessed via EMRs/EHRs). We stratified patients' risks for fibrosis from 2007 to 2017 by modeling the risk in 5579 individuals. The process involved time-series machine learning models (Hidden Markov Models and Group-Based Trajectory Models) profiled fibrosis risk by modeling patients' latent medical status resulted in three groups. The high-risk group had abnormal lab test values and a higher prevalence of chronic conditions. This study can help overcome the inefficient, traditional process of detecting fibrosis via biopsies (that are also medically unfeasible due to their invasive nature, the medical resources involved, and costs) at early stages. Thus longitudinal risk assessment may be used to make population-specific medical recommendations targeting early detection of high risk patients, to avoid the development of fibrosis disease and its complications as well as decrease healthcare costs.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007752/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S1532-0464(22)00002-8 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jbi.2022.103986", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States"}, {"uid": 37191918, "aid": "10.1007/s12664-022-01335-3 10.1007/s12664-022-01335-3", "titl": "Diagnostic performance of non-invasive liver fibrosis risk scores in biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients in India.", "mesh": "Male;;; Humans;;; Female;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/complications;;; Retrospective Studies;;; Biomarkers;;; Liver Cirrhosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology;;; Risk Factors;;; Fibrosis;;; Biopsy;;; Liver/pathology;;; Severity of Illness Index", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Prasad, Manya; Gupta, Sunanda; Kashyap, Nikky; Kapil, Umesh", "jour": "Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology", "affl": "Department of Epidemiology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, D-1, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, 110 070, India.;;; Department of Epidemiology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, D-1, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, 110 070, India.;;; Department of Epidemiology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, D-1, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, 110 070, India.;;; Department of Epidemiology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, D-1, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, 110 070, India. umeshkapil1953@gmail.com.", "pdat": "2023 Apr", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide.

The present study was conducted to assess the diagnostic performance of two non-invasive risk scores, fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), in Indian patients of biopsy-proven NAFLD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of biopsy-proven NAFLD patients that reported to our center between 2009 and 2015. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and two non-invasive fibrosis scores, NFS and FIB-4 score, were calculated using the original formulas. Liver biopsy was utilized as gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD, diagnostic performance was determined by plotting receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was calculated for each score. RESULTS: The mean age of 272 patients included was 40 (11.85) years and 187 (79.24%) were men. We found that the AUROCs for FIB-4 score (0.634) was higher for any degree of fibrosis as compared to NFS (0.566). The AUROC for FIB-4 for advanced liver fibrosis was 0.640 (.550-.730). The performance of the scores for advanced liver fibrosis was comparable with overlapping confidence intervals for both scores.

Levels of fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) at each participant's residential address were estimated using multiple satellite-based aerosol optical depth data combined with a chemical transport model. PA volume was calculated as hours of metabolic equivalent tasks per week (MET-h/week) based on a standard self-administered questionnaire. Incident NAFLD was defined as the first occurrence of a fatty liver index (FLI) value > 30 or a hepatic steatosis index (HSI) value > 36 in participants without NAFLD at the baseline. Time-varying Cox regression was used to evaluate the combined effects of PA and PM(2.5). RESULTS: Exposure to PM(2.5) was positively associated with NAFLD.

It has become more and more common in Japan, China and most western developed countries. The global prevalence rate is 25.24%, and the trend is increasing year by year. Related studies have shown that Cynarine has certain liver protection, lipid lowering and immune intervention effects. So, this study to systematically predict and analyze the mechanism of Cynarine in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) based on the integration of network pharmacology, molecular docking, and cell experiment. METHODS: We performed Heatmap and Venn diagram analyses to identify genes and targets in Cynarine treat NAFLD. The network of Cynarine-therapeutic targets and the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed. We used gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses to visualize associated functional pathways. The Sybyl tool was used to dock the Cynarine with key therapeutic targets molecularly. Finally, cell experiments were applied to validate the role of Cynarine in the treatment of NAFLD. RESULTS: The Cynarine could act on 48 targets of NAFLD, and the role of CASP3, TP53, MMP9, ELANE, NOTCH1 were more important. The PPI network showed that immune and inflammation-related targets played a pivotal role. The KEGG analysis found that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cell cycle and MAPK signaling pathway may be the main pathways for Cynarine to prevent and treat NAFLD. Molecular docking studies confirmed that Cynarine has good binding activity with therapeutic targets.

Hence, this study aims to assess the associations between the consumption of major foods with added fructose and NAFLD in a meta-analysis. Methods: Through PubMed and Web of Science, an extensive literature search of publications before July 2022 was conducted. We included studies that investigated the associations between the intake of >/=1 food sources with added fructose (biscuits and cookies, cake, sugar-sweetened beverages [SSBs], sweets, candies, chocolate, or ice cream) and NAFLD in a general adult population. Random- or fixed-effects models were used to pool odds ratios [ORs, 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)] depending on the degree of heterogeneity. Results: A total of 15 studies with 65 149 participants were finally brought into the meta-analysis. Based on the results, it seems that the prevalence of NAFLD was higher among those who consumed foods with added fructose (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.17-1.48). Subgroup analysis showed that consumption of foods with added fructose was associated with a greater prevalence of NAFLD in subgroups of cohort and cross-sectional studies, of SSBs, participants from Asia or North America, disease assessment using ultrasound, CT, or MRI, and exposure assessment using dietary recall and food frequency questionnaires.

MetS can progress to metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a vast-growing etiology of primary liver tumors which are major indications for liver surgery. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the impact of MetS on complications and long-term outcomes after hepatectomy. METHODS: The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO prior to data extraction. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for publications on liver resections and MetS. Comparative studies were included. Outcomes encompassed postoperative complications, mortality, and long-term oncologic status. Data were pooled as odds ratio (OR) with a random-effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool (QUIPS), and the certainty of the evidence was evaluated with GRADE. Subgroup analyses for patients with histopathologically confirmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) versus controls were performed. RESULTS: The meta-analyses included fifteen comparative studies. Patients with MetS suffered significantly more overall complications (OR 1.55; 95% CI [1.05; 2.29]; p=0.03), major complications (OR 1.97 95% CI [1.13; 3.43]; p=0.02; I(2)=62%), postoperative hemorrhages (OR 1.76; 95% CI [1.23; 2.50]; p=0.01) and infections (OR 1.63; 95% CI [1.03; 2.57]; p=0.04). There were no significant differences in mortality, recurrence, 1- or 5-year overall or recurrence-free survivals. Patients with histologically confirmed NAFLD did not have significantly more overall complications; however, PHLF rates were increased (OR 4.87; 95% CI [1.22; 19.47]; p=0.04). Recurrence and survival outcomes did not differ significantly. The certainty of the evidence for each outcome ranged from low to very low. CONCLUSION: Patients with MetS that undergo liver surgery suffer more complications, such as postoperative hemorrhage and infection but not liver-specific complications-PHLF and biliary leakage. Histologically confirmed NAFLD is associated with significantly higher PHLF rates, yet, survivals of these patients are similar to patients without the MetS. Further studies should focus on identifying the tipping point for increased risk in patients with MetS-associated liver disease, as well as reliable markers of MAFLD stages and early markers of PHLF.

It was discovered that C1q/TNF-related protein 4 (CTRP4) regulates glucolipid metabolism and feeding behavior. However, the correlation between serum CTRP4 and NAFLD in T2DM patients is not yet fully understood. Methods: This study enrolled 188 T2DM participants who were separated into 2 distinct groups (NAFLD and non-NAFLD) according to abdominal ultrasound imaging results. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to evaluate the levels of serum CTRP4. Clinical data and CTRP4 concentration were compared between the two groups. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation of serum CTRP4 levels with NAFLD risk in T2DM patients. Results: Compared with non-NAFLD, the concentration of CTRP4 was lower in NAFLD group (median 2.46 vs. 2.89, P < 0.001). The log(CTRP4) value was found to be negatively correlated with alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference in a Pearson correlation analyses (r = -0.159, -0.156, -0.224, -0.268, all P < 0.05); besides, the trend chi(2) test demonstrated that the prevalence of NAFLD rose as CTRP4 concentration decreased (P < 0.001). Regression analysis suggested that NAFLD served as an independent factor influencing log(CTRP4) independently (beta-coefficient = -0.12, P = 0.011), even after adjusting for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and white blood cells. Finally, the results of the logistic regression analysis demonstrated that BMI [odds ratio (OR) = 1.196, P = 0.028], triglyceride (OR = 2.744, P < 0.001), and CTRP4 (OR = 0.615, P = 0.032) were independently associated with NAFLD in T2DM.

The genetic variant Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) plays an important role in the development of a number of liver diseases ranging from steatosis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC. Due to the increase in the prevalence of NAFLD, new models are being developed with machine learning, deep learning, artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) to determine low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic methods.

Patients with NAFLD-related HCC had slightly higher overall survival (HR 0.87, 95 per cent c.i. 0.75 to 1.02) and recurrence-free survival (HR 0.93, 95 per cent c.i. 0.84 to 1.02) than those with HCC of other aetiologies. In the various subgroup analyses, the only significant finding was that Asian patients with NAFLD-related HCC had significantly better overall survival (HR 0.82, 95 per cent c.i. 0.71 to 0.95) and recurrence-free survival (HR 0.88, 95 per cent c.i. 0.79 to 0.98) than Asian patients with HCC of other aetiologies. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests that patients with NAFLD-related HCC have similar perioperative complications and mortality, but potentially longer overall and recurrence-free survival, compared with those with HCC of other aetiologies.

Among the multiple factors, genetic variation acts as important modifiers. Klotho, an enzyme encoded by the klotho (KL) gene in human, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunctions. However, the impact of variants in KL on NAFLD risk remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of KL rs495392 C>A polymorphism on the histological severity of NAFLD. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of the KL rs495392 polymorphism on liver histology in 531 Chinese with NAFLD and replicated that in the population-based Rotterdam Study cohort. The interactions between the rs495392, vitamin D, and patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) rs738409 polymorphism were also analyzed. RESULTS: Carriage of the rs495392 A allele had a protective effect on steatosis severity (odds ratio [OR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.89; P=0.010) in Chinese patients. After adjustment for potential confounders, the A allele remained significant with a protective effect (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.98; P=0.040). The effect on hepatic steatosis was confirmed in the Rotterdam Study cohort. Additional analysis showed the association between serum vitamin D levels and NAFLD specifically in rs495392 A allele carriers, but not in non-carriers. Moreover, we found that the rs495392 A allele attenuated the detrimental impact of PNPLA3 rs738409 G allele on the risk of severe hepatic steatosis.

METHODS: The subjects in this study were 14,251 individuals from the NAfld in the Gifu Area, Longitudinal Analysis (NAGALA) cohort who underwent routine health examination. We integrated BMI with WC and with ABSI to construct 6 combined obesity indicators-obesity phenotypes, the combined anthropometric risk index (ARI) for BMI and ABSI, optimal proportional combination O(BMI+WC) and O(BMI+ABSI), and multiplicative combination BMI*WC and BMI*ABSI. Several multivariable logistic regression models were established to evaluate the relationship between BMI, WC, ABSI, and the above six combined indicators and NAFLD; receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to compare the ability of each obesity indicator to identify NAFLD. RESULTS: A total of 2,507 (17.59%) subjects were diagnosed with NAFLD. BMI, WC, ABSI, and all other combined obesity indicators were significantly and positively associated with NAFLD in the current study, with BMI*WC having the strongest correlation with NAFLD in female subjects (OR per SD increase: 3.13) and BMI*ABSI having the strongest correlation in male subjects (OR per SD increase: 2.97). ROC analysis showed that ARI and O(BMI+ABSI) had the best diagnostic performance in both sexes, followed by BMI*WC (area under the curve: female 0.8912; male 0.8270). After further age stratification, it was found that ARI and multiplicative indicators (BMI*WC, BMI*ABSI) and optimal proportional combination indicators (O(BMI+WC), O(BMI+ABSI)) significantly improved the NAFLD risk identification ability of the basic anthropometric parameters in middle-aged females and young and middle-aged males. CONCLUSION: In the general population, BMI combined with ABSI best identified obesity-related NAFLD risk and was significantly better than BMI or WC, or ABSI.

Early recognition of liver fibrosis may have clinical implication. Non invasive assessment tool for severity of liver fibrosis in NAFLD is expensive fibroscan. An alternate method of diagnosis will be very useful innovation. We aimed to evaluate Carotid Intima Media Thickness (CIMT) and its association with severity of liver fibrosis in patients with type 2 DM and NAFLD. METHODS: Treatment naive patients with type 2 DM were enrolled. Measurement of CIMT, hepatic ultrasound and fibroscan were done. Liver function tests included hepatic transaminases. The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using IBM SPSS version 20.0 software. RESULT: Prevalence of NAFLD was 76% including 12% with moderate to advance liver fibrosis in patients with type 2 DM. CIMT was significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than with normal liver. CIMT positively correlated with severity of liver fibrosis measured by fibroscan. ROC curve analysis showed right CIMT value of 0.575 mm predicting liver fibrosis with sensitivity of 91.7% and specificity of 78.9%. CONCLUSION: Three fourth of patients with type 2 DM had NAFLD but small proportion had moderate to advance liver fibrosis. CIMT increased more in patients with NAFLD than with normal liver in T2DM.

METHODS: Patients attending the AMU over a 3-month period were invited to participate. Patients with excess alcohol consumption or pre-existing liver disease were excluded. Using established FLI cut-offs, 414 participants were grouped into low (FLI </= 30), medium (30 < FLI </= 60) and high (FLI > 60) risk of NAFLD. High-risk patients were offered review including liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were at low-risk, 96 at medium-risk and 184 at high-risk of NAFLD. Male sex (P < 0.0001) and increasing age (P < 0.0001) were associated with higher risk.

Danggui Shaoyao Powder (DGSY) is a classic prescription commonly used in clinical practice and has been shown to reduce hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD. In addition, previous studies have shown that DGSY can alleviate hepatic steatosis and inflammation in NAFLD mice. Although clinical practice and basic studies have shown that DGSY is effective in NAFLD, high levels of clinical evidence are lacking. Therefore, a standardized RCT study protocol is required to evaluate its clinical efficacy and safety. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and single-center trial. According to the random number table, NAFLD participants will be randomly divided into the DGSY or placebo group for 24 weeks. The follow-up period will be 6 weeks after drug withdrawal. The primary outcome is the relative change in MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) from baseline to 24 weeks. Absolute changes in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver stiffness measurement (LSM), body mass index (BMI), blood lipid, blood glucose, and insulin resistance index will be selected as secondary outcomes to comprehensively evaluate the clinical efficacy of DGSY in the treatment of NAFLD. The safety of DGSY will be evaluated by renal function, routine blood and urine tests, and electrocardiogram. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence-based medical corroboration for the clinical application of DGSY and promote the development and application of this classic prescription.

RESULTS: Acupuncture effectively improved body weight, blood glucose, and insulin levels in T2DM with NAFLD mouse models and reversed steatosis within hepatocytes. Quantitative TMT-based proteomics analysis identified a total of 4710 quantifiable proteins and 1226 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the model control group (MCG) compared with the normal control group (NCG). The Acupuncture Treatment Group (ATG) presented in 122 DEPs was compared with the MCG group. We performed a bioinformatics analysis, which revealed that DEPs enriched in the KEGG pathway after acupuncture treatment were mainly involved in the PPAR signaling pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid elongation, fat digestion and absorption.

METHODS: Children with NAFLD, who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging with proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) for steatosis quantification and/or magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) for liver stiffness assessment were included. We used data from patients imaged between April 2009 to July 2018 to develop a predictive model for fat fraction and stiffness. We validated the performance of the models using data from a second cohort, imaged between 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: The first cohort (n = 344) consisted of predominantly non-Hispanic (80%), male (67%) adolescents. MRE data were available for 343 children, while PDFF data were available for 130. In multivariable regression, ethnicity, insulin levels, platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase independently predicted liver stiffness and these variables were used to develop the predictive model. Similarly, sex, ethnicity, alanine aminotransferase, and triglycerides levels independently predicted liver PDFF and were used in the PDFF model. The AUC of the optimal cutoff for the model that predicted a stiffness of >2.71 kPa was 0.70 and for the model that predicted PDFF >5% was 0.78. The validation group (n = 110) had similar characteristics. The correlation coefficient of the model with the measured liver stiffness was 0.30 and with the measured liver PDFF was 0.26.

At the present stage, a persistent pathophysiological interaction between NAFLD and T2DM has been demonstrated. Insulin resistance is one of the main pathogenetic causes of the development of T2DM and NAFLD. At the same time, it is necessary to highlight the role of the intestinal microbiota and epigenome in the manifestation and progression of NAFLD. Therefore, treatment approaches should be comprehensive. Diet therapy should be aimed at calorie restriction. However, in real clinical practice, phisicians face a low commitment to appropriate and long-term dietary recommendations necessary for weight loss. At the same time, use of dietary fibers, which are part of the preparation Mucofalk, helps to slow down the passage of food through the digestive tract, increase the saturation period. Use of a low-calorie diet with a significant fat restriction may increase the risk of gallstones. Ursodeoxycholic acid preparations (Ursofalk) can be recommended for the prevention of cholelithiasis. Considering the role of intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, it is necessary to correct dysbiotic changes as well as basic pharmacotherapy.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common within this phenotype; however, its incidence and clinical significance in EAC have not been studied. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 559 patients with hepatic stetatosis (HS) defined by unenhanced CT were enrolled. In a sub-study, in 140 consecutive patients a liver biopsy was taken intraoperatively to study HS and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Postoperative complications were defined as per the Esophageal Complications Consensus Group (ECCG). Liver biochemistry was measured peri-operatively, with an ALT > 5 defined as acute liver injury (ALI). Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher's exact test was utilized and the Kaplan-Meier method for survival. RESULTS: 42% (n = 234/559) of patients had CT-defined HS.

Current guidelines propose monitoring the progression of NAFLD using repeated NITs at 2-3-year intervals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of changes in NITs measured at two time points with the progression of NAFLD. METHODS: We retrospectively included NAFLD patients with NIT measurements in whom the baseline hepatic fibrosis stage had been assessed by biopsy or transient elastography (TE). Subjects underwent follow-up visits at least 1 year from baseline to evaluate the progression of NAFLD. NAFLD progression was defined as the development of end-stage liver disease or fibrosis progression according to repeat biopsy or TE. The following NITs were calculated at baseline and follow-up: Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and dynamic aspartate-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio (dAAR). RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-five patients were included with a mean follow-up of 12.6 +/- 8.5 years. During follow-up, 41 patients (30%) were diagnosed with progressive NAFLD. Change in NIT scores during follow-up was significantly associated with disease progression for all NITs tested except for NFS. However, the diagnostic precision was suboptimal with area under the receiver operating characteristics 0.56-0.64 and positive predictive values of 0.28-0.36 at sensitivity fixed at 90%.

C57BL/6 mice were divided into the control diet (CON) group, the HFD group, and the treatment (HFD+FA) group, fed with an HFD and FA (100 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 12 weeks. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining were used to evaluate liver tissue pathological changes and lipid accumulation respectively. It was demonstrated that FA supplementation prevented HFD-induced NAFLD, which was evidenced by the decreased accumulation of lipid and hepatic steatosis in the HFD+FA group. Specifically, FA supplementation decreased hepatic triacylglycerol (TG) content by 33.5% (p < 0.01). Metabolic cage studies reveal that FA-treated mice have elevated energy expenditure by 11.5% during dark phases. Mechanistically, FA treatment increases the expression of rate-limiting enzymes of fatty acid oxidation and ketone body biosynthesis CPT1A, ACOX1 and HMGCS2, which are the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha (PPARalpha) targets in liver.

This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of NAFLD screening among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, and to establish a price threshold for NAFLD treatment, when it becomes available. METHOD: A Markov model was constructed comparing 4 screening strategies (versus no screening) to identify NAFLD with advanced fibrosis among T2DM patients: fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), FIB-4 and VCTE (simultaneous), and FIB-4 and VCTE (sequential). Sensitivity analyses and price threshold analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainties in the results. RESULTS: VCTE was the most cost-effective NAFLD screening strategy (USD24,727/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), followed by FIB-4 (USD36,800/QALY), when compared to no screening. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a higher degree of certainty for VCTE as a cost-effective strategy compared to FIB-4 (90.7% versus 73.2%). The duration of expected screening benefit is the most influential variable based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio tornado analysis. The minimum duration of screening benefit for NAFLD screening to be cost-effective was at least 2.6 years. The annual cost of NAFLD treatment should be less than USD751 for NAFLD screening to be cost-effective.

Whether it better coheres with the clinical demand remains controversial. METHODS: The participants with fatty liver on ultrasonography in Taiwan bio-bank cohorts were included. MAFLD is defined as the presence of fatty liver, plus any of the following three conditions: overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), or metabolic dysfunction. The severity of liver fibrosis was determined using fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was assessed using intima-media thickness (IMT) or plaques of carotid duplex ultrasound. RESULTS: A total of 9,719 subjects (ages 55.9 +/- 10.8; males 42.6%) were distributed among 4 groups: \"overlapping group\", \"MAFLD only\", \"NAFLD only\", and \"neither fatty liver disease (FLD)\" with the percentages of 79.7, 12, 7.1, and 1.2%, respectively. Compared with NAFLD patients, MAFLD patients had a greater percentage of males, higher levels of BMI, waist circumference, HbA1c, and triglyceride. In addition, they had higher levels of serum ALT, AST, GGT, fatty liver index (FLI), NFS, and IMT, but no difference in FIB-4 index and the percentage of carotid plaques. To note, \"MAFLD only group\" had greater levels of AST, ALT, GGT, FLI, FIB-4, NFS, IMT and a higher percentage of carotid plaques than the \"NAFLD only group\".

A high-cholesterol diet (HCD) was chosen to induce NAFLD zebrafish model, and the antioxidant and lipid-lowering effects of DHPL were evaluated. Histological alterations of NAFLD were also scored along with gene expression to explore the molecular mechanism. DHPL reduced lipid accumulation in both short-term and long-term feeding trials.

METHODS: In the present study, we fed zebrafish a high-fat diet to model NAFLD, and subjected the zebrafish to swimming exercise. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, swimming exercise significantly reduced high-fat diet-induced liver injury, and reduced inflammation and fibrosis markers. Swimming exercise improved mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, inducing upregulation of optic atrophy 1(OPA1), dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1), and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) protein expression. Swimming exercise also activated mitochondrial biogenesis via the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/ PPARgamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1alpha) pathway, and improved the mRNA expression of genes related to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we find that mitophagy was suppressed in NAFLD zebrafish liver with the decreased numbers of mitophagosomes, the inhibition of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) - parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PARKIN) pathway and upregulation of sequestosome 1 (P62) expression.

HEBCS was subjected to liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry, and 30 male BALB/c mice (28 +/- 2 g) were allocated to three (3) experimental groups (n = 10/group). Mice in group I were fed chow diet (CD); those in group II, high fat diet (HFD) and group III, HFD and 250 mg/kg HEBCS p.o. daily for six weeks. HEBCS alleviates HFD-induced insulin resistance and high plasma insulin and glucose levels. It further alleviates hepatic steatosis, and alters plasma lipid profile. HEBCS also protected against HFD-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and hepatocellular damage. In conclusion, HEBCS alleviated NAFLD in mice via suppression of insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, inflammation and oxidative stress. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Bioactive polyphenols and alkaloids were identified in hydroethanolic extract of defatted Buccholzia coriacea seeds (HEBCS). This study projects HEBCS as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of NAFLD. NAFLD is a multi-factorial condition and therefore, HEBCS is promising considering its multiple-target actions in the current model of NAFLD.

NAFLD prevalence was determined by liver enzyme (serum glutamic pyruvic transferase) levels, ultrasonography, shear wave elastography and aspartate aminotransferase/platelet index. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent risk factors for NAFLD. RESULTS: The frequency of NAFLD was found to be 28.8% in patients with paediatric psoriasis compared with 3.8% in HCs. Logistic regression showed that greater disease severity (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index >/= 10), obesity and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level were independently associated with NAFLD, and thus can be considered risk factors for NAFLD.

This study aimed to refine the efficacy and safety assessment of JPHX for NAFLD with magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) as the primary outcome. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The trial will enrol 84 NAFLD participants who will be equally randomized to receive either JPHX or a placebo for 24 weeks. Follow-up will be performed 12 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome will be the change from baseline to week 24 in MRI-PDFF. Secondary outcomes will be the body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), serum liver function, blood lipids and glucose-related indicators, quality of life measurement health survey, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome scale. Outcomes will be monitored at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after enrolment. Adverse events occurring in this trial will be managed and recorded promptly. DISCUSSION: We designed a clinical trial for the treatment of NAFLD using JPHX, a TCM formulation that has been shown to have a positive effect on hepatic steatosis in a previous self-controlled trial. This trial will use a more recognized and quantitative imaging approach to demonstrate the efficacy of JPHX in the treatment of NAFLD and observe its safety to provide clinical evidence for its translational applications.

Non-invasive tests (NITs) such as FIB-4, NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) and Hepamet, have been proposed as a tool to triage NAFLD patients in primary care (PC). These NITs include AST+/-ALT in their calculations. Many patients with NAFLD take statins, which can affect AST/ALT, but it is unknown if statin affects NITs fibrosis prediction. METHODS: We included 856 patients referred through a standardised pathway from PC with a final diagnosis of NAFLD. 832 had reliable vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) measurements. We assessed the effects of statins on the association between NITs and VCTE at different fibrosis thresholds. RESULTS: 129 out of 832 patients were taking a statin and 138 additional patients had indication for a statin. For any given FIB-4 value, patients on a statin had higher probabilities of high VCTE than patients not on a statin. Adjusting for body mass index, diabetes and age almost completely abrogated these differences, suggesting that these were related to patient's profile rather to a specific effect of statins. Negative predictive values (NPVs) of FIB-4 <1.3 for VCTE >8, 10, 12 and 16 were, respectively, 89, 94, 96% and 100% in patients on a statin and 92, 95, 98% and 99% in patients not on a statin. Statins had similar impact on Hepamet predictions but did not modify NFS predictions. CONCLUSION: In patients with NAFLD referred from PC, those on statins had higher chances of a high VCTE for a given FIB-4 value, but this had a negligible impact on the NPV of the commonly used FIB-4 threshold (<1.3).", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992072/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/bmjgast-2021-000798 https://sci-hub.do/10.1136/bmjgast-2021-000798", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 35302179, "aid": "10.1007/s11739-022-02966-2 10.1007/s11739-022-02966-2", "titl": "Liver stiffness measurement identifies subclinical myocardial dysfunction in non-advanced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients without overt heart disease.", "mesh": "Echocardiography;;; Female;;; *Heart Diseases;;; Humans;;; Male;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging;;; Reproducibility of Results;;; *Ventricular Dysfunction, Left", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Sonaglioni, Andrea; Cerini, Federica; Cerrone, Antonio; Argiento, Lorenzo; Nicolosi, Gian Luigi; Rigamonti, Elisabetta; Lombardo, Michele; Rumi, Maria Grazia; Vigano, Mauro", "jour": "Internal and emergency medicine", "affl": "Division of Cardiology, Ospedale San Giuseppe MultiMedica IRCCS, Via San Vittore 12, 20123, Milan, Italy. sonaglioniandrea@gmail.com.;;; Division of Hepatology, Ospedale San Giuseppe MultiMedica IRCCS, Via San Vittore 12, 20123, Milan, Italy.;;; University of Milan, Milan, Italy.;;; Division of Hepatology, Ospedale San Giuseppe MultiMedica IRCCS, Via San Vittore 12, 20123, Milan, Italy.;;; University of Milan, Milan, Italy.;;; Division of Hepatology, Ospedale San Giuseppe MultiMedica IRCCS, Via San Vittore 12, 20123, Milan, Italy.;;; University of Milan, Milan, Italy.;;; Division of Cardiology, Policlinico San Giorgio, Pordenone, Italy.;;; Division of Cardiology, Ospedale San Giuseppe MultiMedica IRCCS, Via San Vittore 12, 20123, Milan, Italy.;;; Division of Cardiology, Ospedale San Giuseppe MultiMedica IRCCS, Via San Vittore 12, 20123, Milan, Italy.;;; Division of Hepatology, Ospedale San Giuseppe MultiMedica IRCCS, Via San Vittore 12, 20123, Milan, Italy.;;; University of Milan, Milan, Italy.;;; Division of Hepatology, Ospedale San Giuseppe MultiMedica IRCCS, Via San Vittore 12, 20123, Milan, Italy.;;; University of Milan, Milan, Italy.", "pdat": "2022 Aug", "tiab": "Patients with non-advanced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have an increased cardiovascular risk.

METHODS: Biochemical and biophysical parameters were analysed in pregnant women with period of gestation <12 weeks was done among Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort, Sri Lanka. Fatty liver was graded as (FLG) 0, I or II by ultrasound scan. Binary logistic regression models were employed to identify the factors predicting FLG-II. Six FLIs were developed to predict FLG-II. Validity of the FLIs was compared using the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 632 pregnant women with a mean age of 28.8 years (SD: 5.8 years). Age (OR: 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3), body mass index (OR: 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.5) and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (OR: 2.1, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.0) were the independent predictors of FLG-II.

METHODS: Seventy-five French HGEs working in hospitals or in private practice, who regularly managed patients with NAFLD, completed three questionnaires: one about their opinions about disease management, one on the 10 first patients with NAFLD they saw in February 2020, and the third about the first five patients meeting the 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria for specialist referral. RESULTS: Management of NAFLD was seen as challenging, complex, time-consuming, and frustrating. Available treatments were considered to be unsatisfactory by most participants. In the whole population studied (671 patients), 41% were obese, 50% overweight, 49% had type 2 diabetes, 61% dyslipidemia, 51% arterial hypertension, 57% nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH), 37% advanced fibrosis, and 19% cirrhosis. In the subgroup of 313 patients needing specialist referral, the use of liver biopsy was low (30%) and decreasing, whereas vibration-controlled transient elastometry was high (66%) and increasing; blood fibrosis tests were rarely used. NASH was usually diagnosed without liver biopsy. Nutritional counseling was provided to 3/4 patients, physical activity counseling in 1/5. A personalized therapeutic project was defined in less than one-third of patients. Ursodeoxycholic acid and vitamin E were used in a minority of patients.

RESULT: A total of 115 genes were discovered to be shared between NAFLD and T2D in the GWAS analysis. The enrichment analysis of these genes showed that some were involved in the processes such as the decomposition and metabolism of lipids, phospholipids, and glycerophospholipids. Additionally, through the use of differential gene expression analysis, 15 core genes were confirmed to be linked to both T2D and NAFLD. They were correlated with carcinoma cells and inflammation. Furthermore, the bidirectional MR identified a positive causal relationship between NAFLD and T2D.

The cancer burden of NAFLD complicated by IS also warrants attention. This study aimed to identify candidate immune biomarkers linked to NAFLD and IS and analyze their association with cancer. METHODS: Two of each of the NAFLD and IS datasets were downloaded, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and module genes were screened via weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Subsequently, utilizing machine learning (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, random forest and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination) and immune cell infiltration analysis, immune-related candidate biomarkers for NAFLD with IS were determined. Simultaneously, a nomogram was established, the diagnostic efficacy was assessed, and the role of candidate biomarkers in cancer was ascertained through pan-cancer analyses. RESULTS: In this study, 117 and 98 DEGs were identified from the combined NAFLD and IS datasets, respectively, and 279 genes were obtained from the most significant modules of NAFLD. NAFLD module genes and IS DEGs were intersected to obtain nine genes, which were enriched in the inflammatory response and immune regulation. After overlapping the results of the three machine learning algorithms, six candidate genes were obtained, based on which a nomogram was constructed. The calibration curve demonstrated good accuracy, and the candidate genes had high diagnostic values. The genes were found to be related to the immune dysregulation of stroke, and RRS1 was strongly associated with the prognosis, immune cell infiltration, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutation burden (TMB). CONCLUSION: Six common candidate immune-related genes (PTGS2, FCGR1A, MMP9, VNN3, S100A12, and RRS1) of NAFLD and IS were identified, and a nomogram for diagnosing NAFLD with IS was established.

As a serious chronic disease, NAFLD is clinically managed with pharmacological interventions that are usually associated with poor long-term efficacy and adverse effects. In this scenario, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) characterized by \"multiple ingredients-multiple targets-multiple pathways\" shows promise as a potential option to treat NAFLD. Zexie decoction (ZXD) is a classical TCM formula that possesses favorable lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory activities. Accumulating evidence indicates that ZXD displays robust efficacy in treating NAFLD. The effectiveness of ZXD against NAFLD has been evaluated in our previous studies. This study further examines its probable mechanism of action in an in-depth manner using multi-omic analysis based on the gut-liver axis and sheds light on the potential relationship among genes, hepatic lipid metabolites, and gut microbiotas. Totally, 71 differentially expressed genes (34 upregulated and 37 downregulated genes), 31 differential lipid molecules (8 upregulated and 23 downregulated), and 56 differential gut microbiotas (37 upregulated and 19 downregulated) were identified in the ZXD-treated group rats compared with the negative control group rats. Of these, owing to their key role in the association analysis, g_Blautia, g_Romboutsia, and g_Lactobacillus were hypothesized to be crucial gut microbiotas in the ZXD-mediated treatment of NAFLD. These microbiotas were found to synergize with key genes, such as AKR1B8, CCN1, and TNKS2, and hepatic lipid metabolites, such as glycerophospholipid and sphingomyelin, which might play a therapeutic role by regulating fatty acid synthesis, correcting lipid metabolism disorder, or reducing the inflammatory response.

In the current study, we aimed to examine the possible association of dietary AGEs with the odds of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Iranian adults. METHODS: A total of 675 participants (225 newly diagnosed NAFLD cases and 450 controls), aged  20-60 years, were recruited for this case-control study. Nutritional data were measured using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and dietary AGEs were determined for all participants. An ultrasound scan of the liver performed the detection of NAFLD in participants of the case group without alcohol consumption and other causes of hepatic disorders. We used logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, to estimate the odds ratios(ORs) and 95% confidence interval(CI) of NAFLD across tertiles of dietary AGEs. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD age and body mass index of the participants were 38.13 +/- 8.85 years and 26.85 +/- 4.31 kg/m(2), respectively. The median(IQR) of dietary AGEs in participants was 3262(2472-4301). In the sex and age-adjusted model, the odds of NAFLD were increased across tertiles of dietary AGEs intake(OR:16.48;95%CI:9.57-28.40, P(trend)<0.001). Also, in the final model, after controlling for confounding effects of BMI, smoking, physical activity, marital status, socio-economic status, and energy intake, the odds of NAFLD were increased across tertiles of dietary AGEs intake(OR:12.16; 95%CI:6.06-24.39, P(trend)<0.001).

Recently, alternative splicing (AS) has been reported to play a key role in NAFLD processes in mammals. Ducks can quickly form fatty liver similar to human NAFLD after overfeeding and restore to normal liver in a short time, suggesting that ducks are an excellent model to unravel molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism for NAFLD. However, how alternative splicing events (ASEs) affect the fatty liver process in ducks is still unclear. RESULTS: Here we identify 126,277 unique transcripts in liver tissue from an overfed duck (77,237 total transcripts) and its sibling control (69,618 total transcripts). We combined these full-length transcripts with Illumina RNA-seq data from five pairs of overfed ducks and control individuals. Full-length transcript sequencing provided us with structural information of transcripts and Illumina RNA-seq data reveals the expressional profile of each transcript. We found, among these unique transcripts, 30,618 were lncRNAs and 1,744 transcripts including 155 lncRNAs and 1,589 coding transcripts showed significantly differential expression in liver tissues between overfed ducks and control individuals. We also detected 27,317 ASEs and 142 of them showed significant relative abundance changes in ducks under different feeding conditions. Full-length transcript profiles together with Illumina RNA-seq data demonstrated that 10 genes involving in lipid metabolism had ASEs with significantly differential abundance in normally fed (control) and overfed ducks. Among these genes, protein products of five genes (CYP4F22, BTN, GSTA2, ADH5, and DHRS2 genes) were changed by ASEs. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents an example of how to identify ASEs related to important biological processes, such as fatty liver formation, using full-length transcripts alongside Illumina RNA-seq data. Based on these data, we screened out ASEs of lipid-metabolism related genes which might respond to overfeeding. Our future ability to explore the function of genes showing AS differences between overfed ducks and their sibling controls, using genetic manipulations and co-evolutionary studies, will certainly extend our knowledge of genes related to the non-pathogenic fatty liver process.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36858953/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1186/s12864-023-09160-4 https://sci-hub.do/9160 https://sci-hub.do/10.1186/s12864-023-09160-4", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 34044131, "aid": "S1542-3565(21)00573-5 10.1016/j.cgh.2021.05.035", "titl": "Validation of the Dallas Steatosis Index to Predict Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in the UK Biobank Population.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology;;; Biological Specimen Banks;;; Weight Loss;;; Prevalence;;; United Kingdom/epidemiology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "McHenry, Scott; Park, Yikyung; Davidson, Nicholas O", "jour": "Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association", "affl": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in Saint Louis, St. Louis, Missouri.

A recently proposed definition of \"metabolic associated fatty liver disease\" (MAFLD) is thought to replace non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Yet, despite the significant prevalence of T2DM among fatty liver, there remains limited evidence on the impact of the change in the definition of T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study uses data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2018. Survival analysis was conducted with a cox regression and sub-distribution hazard ratio for competing risk events. RESULTS: 6727 patients had a diagnosis of T2DM. 4982 individuals with T2DM had MAFLD and 2032 were MAFLD(+)/NAFLD(-), while 2950 patients were MAFLD(+)/NAFLD(+). The new definition increased fatty liver diagnosis by 68.89%. Patients who were classified as MAFLD(+)/NAFLD(-) were at a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, advanced fibrosis, all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality compared to MAFLD(+)/NAFLD(+). In MAFLD(+)/NAFLD(-), viral hepatitis significantly increases the odds of advanced fibrosis (OR: 6.77, CI: 3.92 to 11.7, p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.75, CI: 1.29 to 2.40, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The identification and treatment of NAFLD in patients with T2DM is a major concern and the premature change to MAFLD results in an over-diagnosis of fatty liver, exaggerated mortality, and morbidity in patients with T2DM.

The aim of this work was to clarify the role of noninvasive scoring systems (NSSs) in predicting CVD risk among this population. METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched until 23 March 2022. Meta-analysis was performed for three most commonly used NSS separately, that is, fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), and AST/platelet ratio index (APRI). RESULTS: Totally, nine studies including 155 382 patients with NAFLD were enrolled. Patients with NAFLD had a higher risk of CVD with increasing FIB-4 score (1.94, 1.52-2.46), the association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes (2.44, 1.85-3.22). Similarly, a higher risk of CVD was also observed in patients with increasing NFS (2.17, 1.58-2.98) and APRI scores (1.36, 1.04-1.79) in the unadjusted model. However, in the adjusted model, the association was significant only for NFS (3.83, 1.40-10.43), but not for APRI (1.41, 0.79-2.51). Additionally, the increment in CVD risk was most noticeable in subgroup of FIB &gt; 2.67 vs. FIB </= 1.3 (6.52, 3.07-13.86) and subgroup of NFS &gt; 0.676 vs. NFS </= -1.455 (16.88, 5.68-50.23). All subgroup analyses showed significant associations between FIB-4, NFS, and risk of CVD. Sensitivity analyses did not modify these results.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a retrospective analysis of data from 637 people with T2D, we examined the longitudinal impact of optimizing glycaemic control with DPP-IV inhibitors, GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors on Fatty liver index (FLI) and Fibrosis score 4 (Fib-4) adjusting for changes in BMI and choice of glucose lowering regimen over a 12-month period. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between the change in glycated haemoglobin and change in FLI after adjustment for change in BMI, age, sex, and drug class (R = 0.467, p = 0.031). The greatest reduction in FLI was observed in patients with the largest reduction in glycated haemoglobin (p < 0.0001). The probability of improvements in FLI with optimization of glycaemic control was similar with all 3 glucose lowering agents, despite differences in weight reduction.

This study aimed to estimate the effect of the Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) and exercise (aerobic and resistance) over a one-year period on the longitudinal trajectories of glucose metabolism regulatory pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this observational study, 58 subjects (aged 18-65) with different degrees of NAFLD severity were enrolled by the National Institute of Gastroenterology-IRCCS \"S. de Bellis\", to follow a 12-month program of combined exercise and diet. RESULTS: The mean age was 55 +/- 7 years old. Gender was equally distributed among NAFLD categories. There was a statistically significant main effect of time for glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac) over the whole period (-5.41, 95% CI: -7.51; -3.32).

While physical activity and dietary behaviors have established protective associations with NAFLD and its severity, these associations have not been well-characterized in Hispanic/Latino adults. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of lifestyle behaviors with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis in US Hispanic/Latino adults. DESIGN: We selected all Hispanic/Latino adults from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NAFLD was defined as CAP >/=285 dB/m, and advanced fibrosis as liver stiffness measurements >/=8.6 kPa. Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models assessed associations of physical activity and sedentary behavior (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire), as well as diet quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI]-2015) and total energy intake (24-hour recall) with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis. RESULTS: In Hispanic/Latino adults, the overall prevalence of NAFLD was 41.5%, while the prevalence of advanced fibrosis among those with NAFLD was 17.2%. We found that higher levels of physical activity and high diet quality were associated with lower risk of NAFLD. Compared to those reporting on average 0 metabolic equivalent (MET) hours/week of physical activity, participants reporting high levels of physical activity (>/=32 MET hours/week) had 40% lower risk of NAFLD (Adjusted OR = 0.60, 95%CI 0.38, 0.93).

METHODS: In this study, 129 participants with biopsy-proven euthyroid NAFLD were enrolled, all of whom underwent thyroid function tests and liver biopsy. Indicators reflecting the sensitivity to thyroid hormones were also calculated. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between thyroid hormone sensitivity and risk of advanced liver fibrosis. RESULTS: Among the 129 participants, 40 (31.0%) had advanced fibrosis. Advanced fibrosis was independently associated with TSH, FT3, FT3/FT4, thyrotroph T4 resistance index (TT4RI), TSH index (TSHI), and thyroid feedback quantile-based index (TFQI) (P<0.05), even after adjusting for sex, age, and metabolic factors. The combination of TFQI with age, waist circumference (WC), triglycerides (TGs), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) performed best for advanced fibrosis diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In euthyroid NAFLD patients, higher FT3/FT4, TFQI, TT4RI, and TSHI values were strongly associated with an increased incidence of advanced liver fibrosis.

Fasting blood glucose and circulating insulin were measured. Inflammatory and fibrotic liver markers were assessed by qPCR. The second messenger ERK and autophagy markers were examined by Western immunoblot. F4/80, collagens and CCN2 were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: At termination, HFD mice were obese, hyperinsulinemic and insulin-resistant but non-diabetic. The DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin prevented intrahepatic induction of pro-fibrotic markers collagen-IV, collagen-VI, CCN2 and TGF-beta1 and pro-inflammatory markers TNF-alpha and IL-1beta more effectively than sulfonylurea gliclazide. By IHC, liver collagen-VI and CCN2 induction by HFD were inhibited only by sitagliptin. Sitagliptin had a greater ability than gliclazide to normalise ERK-protein liver dysregulation.

As a quercetin glycoside, isoquercitrin (IQ) has a broad inhibitory effect on oxidative stress, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and allergic reactions in vitro and in vivo. This study aimed to investigate the undercover mechanism of IQ in the treatment of NAFLD, particularly in anti-steatohepatitis, by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome. In this study, a methionine-choline-deficient induced steatohepatitis mice model was used to explore the effect of IQ on NAFLD treatment. Further mechanism exploration based on transcriptomics and molecular biology revealed that IQ inhibited the activated NLRP3 inflammasome by down-regulating the expression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and suppressor of G-two allele of Skp1 (SGT1). In conclusion, IQ could alleviate NAFLD by inhibiting the activated NLRP3 inflammasome by suppressing the expression of HSP90.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37240141/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/ijms24108795 https://sci-hub.do/ijms-24-08795 https://sci-hub.do/10.3390/ijms24108795", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Switzerland"}, {"uid": 36623544, "aid": "10.1055/a-1986-7676", "titl": "Clinical characteristics of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Germany - First data from the German NAFLD-Registry.", "mesh": "Humans;;; Female;;; Middle Aged;;; Male;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy;;; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology;;; Risk Factors;;; Prospective Studies;;; Liver Cirrhosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/complications;;; Germany/epidemiology;;; Registries", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Geier, Andreas; Rau, Monika; Pathil-Warth, Anita; von der Ohe, Manfred; Schattenberg, Jorn; Dikopoulos, Nektarios; Stein, Kerstin; Serfert, Yvonne; Berg, Thomas; Buggisch, Peter; Demir, Munevver; Roeb, Elke; Wiebner, Bianka; Wedemeyer, Heiner; Zeuzem, Stefan; Hofmann, Wolf P", "jour": "Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie", "affl": "University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.;;; University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.;;; Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.;;; Gastroenterologische Studiengesellschaft Herne, Herne, Germany.;;; University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.;;; Praxis Ludwig & Dikopoulos, Dornstadt, Germany.;;; Klinik fur Innere Medizin 1, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.;;; Hepatologie Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.;;; Leberstiftungs-GmbH Deutschland, Hannover, Germany.;;; University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.;;; ifi-Institute for Interdisciplinary Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.;;; Charite University Medicine, Campus Virchow Clinic, Berlin, Germany.;;; Justus Liebig-University Giessen and University Hospital, Giessen, Germany.;;; Deutsche Leberstiftung, Hannover, Germany.;;; Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.;;; Leberstiftungs-GmbH Deutschland, Hannover, Germany.;;; Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.;;; Gastroenterologie am Bayerischen Platz, Berlin, Germany.", "pdat": "2023 Jan", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects more than 18 million individuals in Germany.

RESULTS: From this ongoing study, baseline data of the first 501 patients (mean age 54 years, 48% women) were analysed. 13 % of the study population had a high risk for advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 >/=2.67), approximately one-third had a liver stiffness value >/=9.6kPa measured by transient elastography, and the clinical diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was present in 10%. Typical comorbidities were more prevalent in high risk as compared to low risk patients (FIB-4 <1.3) including arterial hypertension (85 vs. 42%), hypercholesterolemia (39 vs. 16%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (69 vs. 26%). Patients with T2DM (192/501) had a higher NAFLD disease burden as shown by liver stiffness values >/=9.6 kPa (51%) and clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis (20%). Statins were used in 22% of the main population, while in diabetic patients, metformin, GLP-1 agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors were used in 65, 17, and 17%, respectively.

A lipidomics approach was conducted to identify specific lipid species involved in the ameliorative roles of L-carnitine in NAFLD. Compared with a normal control group, the body weight, liver weight, concentrations of TG in the liver and serum AST and ALT levels were dramatically increased by HFD feeding (p < 0.05), accompanied with obvious liver damage and the activation of the hepatic TLR4/NF-kappaB/NLRP3 inflammatory pathway.

The results of a liver lipidomics analysis showed that a total of 12 classes and 145 lipid species were identified in the livers. Serious disorders in lipid profiles were noticed in the livers of the HFD-fed mice, such as an increased relative abundance of TG and a decreased relative abundance of PC, PE, PI, LPC, LPE, Cer and SM (p < 0.05).

A species-specific association between Lactobacillus and obesity and metabolic diseases has been reported. In this study, the microbial composition of ten cases of NASH and ten controls was determined using v3v4 16S amplicon sequencing as well as quantitative PCR (qPCR). Using different statistical approaches, we found an association of Lactobacillus and Lactoccocus with NASH, and an association of Methanobrevibacter, Faecalibacterium and Romboutsia with controls. At the species level, Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis, two species producing ethanol, and Thomasclavelia ramosa, a species already associated with dysbiosis, were associated with NASH. Using qPCR, we observed a decreased frequency of Methanobrevibacter smithii and confirmed the high prevalence of L. fermentum in NASH samples (5/10), while all control samples were negative (p = 0.02).

The gut-liver axis plays an important role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, whether maternal betaine supplementation can alleviate NAFLD in offspring by the gut-liver axis is unknown. C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet for 4 weeks before mating, and supplemented with 1% betaine during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, offspring mice were fed with standard diet to 10 weeks. Maternal betaine supplementation reduced hepatic triglyceride content and alleviated hepatic steatosis in offspring mice exposed to MHFD. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of PPARalpha, CPT1alpha and FATP2 was increased and TNFalpha was reduced by maternal betaine supplementation. Maternal betaine intake decreased the relative abundances of Proteobateria, Desulfovibrio and Ruminococcus, but increased the relative abundances of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides. Moreover, maternal betaine intake increased the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid, in the feces. Gut microbiota and SCFAs were significantly correlated with hepatic triglyceride content and expression of the above genes. Maternal betaine intake had no effect on other gut microbiota-related metabolites (bile acid and trimethylamine-n-oxide).

METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with NAFLD were enrolled. Fifteen patients completed 12 weeks of treatment with prebiotics and dietary fiber. In addition, abdominal MRI scans and blood tests were performed before and after treatment. The MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and MRS-PDFF were measured using the ME-Dixon and (1)H-MRS techniques. The Bland-Altman method and Pearson correlation analysis were used to test the consistency of the two techniques for measuring the liver fat content and the changed values. Besides, correlation analysis was conducted between the MRI-PDFF value and metabolic indicators. RESULTS: In the PDFF quantification of 42 person-times and the monitoring of the PDFF change in 15 patients under treatment, there was a good consistency and a correlation between MRI and MRS. At baseline, MRI-PDFF was positively correlated with insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), fatty liver index (FLI), and liver enzymes. After treatment, the changes in MRI-PDFF were positively correlated with the recovery degree of FLI and liver enzymes.

Cause of death (COD) and predictors of all-cause mortality were subsequently analysed using descriptive statistics and Cox-proportional regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 7079 VCTE records submitted for data linkage, 6341 were matched via data registry linkage. There were 217 deaths over a 22 653 person-year follow-up.

Dysregulation in hepatic lipid metabolism, including increased fatty acid uptake and de novo lipogenesis (DNL), is a hallmark of NAFLD. Here, we investigated dual inhibition of the fatty acid transporter fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme in DNL, for the treatment of NAFLD in mice. Mice with hepatic CD36 deletion (Cd36(LKO)) and wild-type littermates were fed a high-fat diet for 12 wk and treated daily with either oral administration of an ACC inhibitor (GS-834356, Gilead Sciences; ACCi) or vehicle for 8 wk. Neither CD36 deletion or ACC inhibition impacted body composition, energy expenditure, or glucose tolerance. Cd36(LKO) mice had elevated fasting plasma insulin, suggesting mild insulin resistance. Whole body fatty acid oxidation was significantly decreased in Cd36(LKO) mice. Liver triglyceride content was significantly reduced in mice treated with ACCi; however, CD36 deletion caused an unexpected increase in liver triglycerides. This was associated with upregulation of genes and proteins of DNL, including ACC, and decreased liver triglyceride secretion ex vivo. Overall, these data confirm the therapeutic utility of ACC inhibition for steatosis resolution but indicate that inhibition of CD36 is not an effective treatment for NAFLD in mice.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism is a hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we show that dual inhibition of the de novo lipogenesis enzyme, ACC, and hepatic deletion of the fatty acid transporter, CD36, was ineffective for the treatment of NAFLD in mice. This was due to a paradoxical increase in liver triglycerides with CD36 deletion resulting from decreased hepatic triglyceride secretion and increased lipogenic gene expression.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36629823/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1152/ajpendo.00161.2022", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States"}, {"uid": 36774529, "aid": "10.1186/s40001-023-01042-5 1042 10.1186/s40001-023-01042-5", "titl": "Diagnostic efficiency on ultrasound shear wave elastography in evaluation of steatosis severity for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a rat model.", "mesh": "Rats;;; Animals;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnostic imaging/complications/pathology;;; *Elasticity Imaging Techniques;;; Liver Cirrhosis/pathology;;; Liver/diagnostic imaging/pathology;;; Ultrasonography;;; ROC Curve;;; Inflammation/pathology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Wu, Yuhui; Liu, Qianjiao; Wang, Yan; Li, Fangyan; Chan, Lawrence Wing-Chi; Wen, Yong; Yang, Fan; Xiang, Yining; Duan, Qinghong; Luo, Peng; Lei, Pinggui", "jour": "European journal of medical research", "affl": "Department of Radiology, the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, No. 28 Guiyi Street, Yunyan District, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, China.;;; Department of Radiology, the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, No. 28 Guiyi Street, Yunyan District, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, China.;;; Department of Radiology, the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, No. 28 Guiyi Street, Yunyan District, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, China.;;; Department of Radiology, the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, No. 28 Guiyi Street, Yunyan District, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, China.;;; Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, SAR, China.;;; Department of Radiology, the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, No. 28 Guiyi Street, Yunyan District, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, China.;;; School of Biology & Engineering, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang,, Guizhou, China.;;; Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.;;; Department of Radiology, the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, No. 28 Guiyi Street, Yunyan District, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, China.;;; School of Public Health, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.;;; Department of Radiology, the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, No. 28 Guiyi Street, Yunyan District, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, China. pingguilei@foxmail.com.;;; School of Public Health, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China. pingguilei@foxmail.com.;;; Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, SAR, China. pingguilei@foxmail.com.", "pdat": "2023 Feb 11", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: The pathological feature of steatosis affects the elasticity values measured by shear wave elastography (SWE) is still controversial in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study is to demonstrate the influence of steatosis on liver stiffness measured by SWE on a rat model with NAFLD and analyze feasibility of SWE for grading steatosis in absence of fibrosis. METHODS: Sixty-six rats were fed with methionine choline deficient diet or standard diet to produce various stages of steatosis; 48 rats were available for final analysis. Rats underwent abdominal ultrasound SWE examination and pathological assessment. Liver histopathology was analyzed to assess the degree of steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis according to the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score. The diagnostic performance of SWE for differentiating steatosis stages was estimated according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was conducted to determine clinical usefulness and the areas under DCA (AUDCAs) calculated. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, steatosis was an independent factor affecting the mean elastic modules (B = 1.558, P < 0.001), but not inflammation (B =  - 0.031, P = 0.920) and ballooning (B = 0.216, P = 0.458). After adjusting for inflammation and ballooning, the AUROC of the mean elasticity for identifying S >/= S1 was 0.956 (95%CI: 0.872-0.998) and the AUDCA, 0.621. The AUROC for distinguishing S >/= S2 and S = S3 was 0.987 (95%CI: 0.951-1.000) and 0.920 (95%CI: 0.816-0.986) and the AUDCA was 0.506 and 0.256, respectively.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of FGF2 on the NAFLD in-vitro model in the HepG2 cell line. METHODS: The in-vitro NAFLD model was first induced on the HepG2 cell line using oleic acid and palmitic acid for 24 h and evaluated by ORO staining and Real-time PCR. The cell line was then treated with various concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 2 for 24 h, total RNA was extracted and cDNA was consequently synthesized. Real-time PCR and flow cytometry was applied to evaluate gene expression and apoptosis rate, respectively. RESULTS: It was shown that fibroblast growth factor 2 ameliorated apoptosis in the NAFLD in-vitro model by reducing the expression of genes involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, including caspase 3 and 9. Moreover, endoplasmic reticulum stress was decreased following upregulating the protective ER-stress genes, including SOD1 and PPARalpha.

Supplementation with MET + MOR led to a decline in hepatic triglyceride levels and this impact was associated with diminished expression of fatty-acid synthase (FAS) and elevated expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) and phospho-Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (p-ACC). Moreover, MET combined with MOR alleviates hepatic inflammation through the polarization of macrophages to the M2 phenotype, decreasing the infiltration of macrophages and lowering the protein level of NF-kB. MET and MOR in combination reduce the size and weight of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), and subcutaneous WAT (sWAT), whereas improves cold tolerance, BAT activity, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Combination therapy results in stimulating brown-like adipocyte (beige) formation in the sWAT of HFD mice. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that the combination of MET and MOR has a protective effect on hepatic steatosis, which may use as a candidate therapeutic for the improvement of NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37075944/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0024-3205(23)00340-5 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121706", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Netherlands"}, {"uid": 35689091, "aid": "10.1038/s41401-022-00926-2 926 10.1038/s41401-022-00926-2", "titl": "Dectin-1 plays a deleterious role in high fat diet-induced NAFLD of mice through enhancing macrophage activation.", "mesh": "Animals;;; Mice;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/etiology/metabolism;;; Diet, High-Fat/adverse effects;;; Macrophage Activation;;; Liver/metabolism;;; Lipids;;; Mice, Inbred C57BL", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Wang, Min-Xiu; Luo, Wu; Ye, Lin; Jin, Lei-Ming; Yang, Bin; Zhang, Qian-Hui; Qian, Jian-Chang; Wang, Yi; Zhang, Yi; Liang, Guang", "jour": "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", "affl": "Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China.;;; Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China.;;; Medical Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China.;;; Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China.;;; Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China.;;; Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China.;;; Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China.;;; Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China.;;; Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China.;;; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 311399, China.;;; Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325035, China. wzmcliangguang@163.com.;;; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 311399, China. wzmcliangguang@163.com.", "pdat": "2023 Jan", "tiab": "The innate immune response and inflammation contribute to hepatic steatosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Dectin-1 is a pathogen recognition receptor in innate immunity. In this study, we investigated the role of Dectin-1 in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. We first showed that Dectin-1 expression was significantly elevated in liver tissues of patients with NASH. NAFLD was induced in mice by feeding high fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks. At the end of treatment, mice were sacrificed, and their blood and liver tissues were collected for analyses. We showed HFD feeding also increased liver Dectin-1 levels in mice, associated with macrophage infiltration. Either gene knockout or co-administration of a Dectin-1 antagonist laminarin (150 mg/kg twice a day, ip, from 16(th) week to 24(th) week) largely protected the livers from HFD-induced lipid accumulation, fibrosis, and elaboration of inflammatory responses. In primary mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs), challenge with palmitate (PA, 200 muM), an abundant saturated fatty acid found in NAFLD, significantly activated Dectin-1 signaling pathway, followed by transcriptionally regulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dectin-1 was required for hepatic macrophage activation and inflammatory factor induction. Condition media generated from Dectin-1 deficient macrophages failed to cause hepatocyte lipid accumulation and hepatic stellate activation. In conclusion, this study provides the primary evidence supporting a deleterious role for Dectin-1 in NAFLD through enhancing macrophage pro-inflammatory responses and suggests that it can be targeted to prevent inflammatory NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35689091/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41401-022-00926-2 https://sci-hub.do/926 https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41401-022-00926-2", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United States"}, {"uid": 37373395, "aid": "ijms241210248 ijms-24-10248 10.3390/ijms241210248", "titl": "Strontium Attenuates Hippocampal Damage via Suppressing Neuroinflammation in High-Fat Diet-Induced NAFLD Mice.", "mesh": "Mice;;; Animals;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism;;; Neuroinflammatory Diseases;;; Diet, High-Fat/adverse effects;;; Hippocampus/metabolism;;; Neuronal Plasticity;;; Mice, Inbred C57BL;;; Liver/metabolism", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Wang, Shuai; Zeng, Fangyuan; Ma, Yue; Yu, Jiaojiao; Xiang, Chenyao; Feng, Xiao; Wang, Songlin; Wang, Jianguo; Zhao, Shanting; Zhu, Xiaoyan", "jour": "International journal of molecular sciences", "affl": "College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.;;; College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.;;; College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.;;; College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.;;; College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.;;; College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.;;; College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.;;; College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.;;; College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.;;; College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Xianyang 712100, China.", "pdat": "2023 Jun 16", "tiab": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) leads to hippocampal damage and causes a variety of physiopathological responses, including the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), neuroinflammation, and alterations in synaptic plasticity.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the protective effects of Sr on hippocampal damage in NAFLD mice in order to elucidate the underlying mechanism of Sr in NAFLD. The mouse model of NAFLD was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD), and the mice were treated with Sr. In the NAFLD mice, we found that treatment with Sr significantly increased the density of c-Fos(+) cells in the hippocampus and inhibited the expression of caspase-3 by suppressing ERS. Surprisingly, the induction of neuroinflammation and the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus following an HFD were attenuated by Sr treatment. Sr significantly attenuated the activation of microglia and astrocytes induced by an HFD. The expression of phospho-p38, ERK, and NF-kappaB was consistently significantly increased in the HFD group, and treatment with Sr decreased their expression. Moreover, Sr prevented HFD-induced damage to the ultra-structural synaptic architecture.

We have previously described the epidemiology of HCC in South America through the South American Liver Research Network. Here, we provide an update on the changing epidemiology of HCC in the continent seven years since that report. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated all cases of HCC diagnosed between 2019 to 2021 in centers from six countries in South America. A templated, retrospective chart review of patient characteristics at the time of HCC diagnosis, including basic demographic, clinical and laboratory data, was completed. Diagnosis of HCC was made radiologically or histologically for all cases via institutional standards. RESULTS: Centers contributed to a total of 339 HCC cases. Peru accounted for 37% (n=125) of patients; Brazil 16% (n=57); Chile 15% (n=51); Colombia 14% (n=48); Argentina 9% (n=29); and Ecuador 9% (n=29). The median age at HCC diagnosis was 67 years (IQR 59-73) and 61% were male. The most common risk factor was nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD, 37%), followed by hepatitis C (17%), alcohol use disorder (11%) and hepatitis B (12%).

However, NAFLD has recently been redefined as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). In this post hoc analysis, we quantified the effect of MAFLD on the outcomes of AP. METHODS: We identified our patients from the multicentric, prospective International Acute Pancreatitis Registry of the Hungarian Pancreatic Study Group. Next, we compared AP patients with and without MAFLD and the individual components of MAFLD regarding in-hospital mortality and AP severity based on the revised Atlanta classification. Lastly, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: MAFLD had a high prevalence in AP, 39% (801/2053). MAFLD increased the odds of moderate-to-severe AP (OR = 1.43, CI: 1.09-1.89). However, the odds of in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.89, CI: 0.42-1.89) and severe AP (OR = 1.70, CI: 0.97-3.01) were not higher in the MAFLD group. Out of the three diagnostic criteria of MAFLD, the highest odds of severe AP was in the group based on metabolic risk abnormalities (OR = 2.68, CI: 1.39-5.09). In addition, the presence of one, two, and three diagnostic criteria dose-dependently increased the odds of moderate-to-severe AP (OR = 1.23, CI: 0.88-1.70, OR = 1.38, CI: 0.93-2.04, and OR = 3.04, CI: 1.63-5.70, respectively) and severe AP (OR = 1.13, CI: 0.54-2.27, OR = 2.08, CI: 0.97-4.35, and OR = 4.76, CI: 1.50-15.4, respectively). Furthermore, in patients with alcohol abuse and aged >/=60 years, the effect of MAFLD became insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: MAFLD is associated with AP severity, which varies based on the components of its diagnostic criteria.

The naturally occurring phytosterol; beta-sitosterol has antiobesogenic and anti-diabetic properties. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of beta-sitosterol in preventing hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in rats. In the current study, to induce NAFLD in the female Wister rats, an HFD was administered to them for 8 weeks. The pathogenic severity of steatosis in rats receiving an HFD diet was dramatically decreased by oral administration of beta-sitosterol. After administering beta-sitosterol to HFD-induced steatosis for three weeks, several oxidative stress-related markers were then assessed. We showed that beta-sitosterol reduced steatosis and the serum levels of triglycerides, transaminases (ALT and AST) and inflammatory markers (IL-1beta and iNOS) compared to HFD-fed rats. Additionally, beta-sitosterol reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress by preventing the overexpression of inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1alpha), X-box binding protein 1(sXBP1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) genes which, showing a function in the homeostatic regulation of protein folding. Also, it was found that the expression of the lipogenic factors; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-alpha), sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1c) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1(CPT-1), which are involved in the regulation of the fatty acid oxidation process, may be regulated by beta-sitosterol. It can be concluded that beta-sitosterol may prevent NAFLD by reducing oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammatory responses, which supports the possibility of using beta-sitosterol as an alternative therapy for NAFLD.

In a single-blind, controlled trial, 32 subjects with NAFLD were randomized to 12 weeks of triweekly 30 minute walking exercise with either HTS (HTS group) or without HTS (control group). Transient elastography for the assessment of liver stiffness, body weight, visceral fat, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, fasting blood glucose, serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were evaluated. Data were evaluated using the linear model after adjusting the baseline value. In the subjects with BMI of 27 kg/m(2) or more, the decrement of transient elastography in the HTS group was significantly larger than in the control group (mean +/- standard error: Delta2.13 +/- 0.64 kPa vs. Delta-0.67 +/- 0.42 kPa, p=0.0009). There were no significant differences between groups in other endpoints. These results showed that simultaneously combining electrical stimulation with walking exercise could potentially improve liver stiffness in people who have NAFLD.

We aimed to investigate the presence and any association of HAdV-36 in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients Methods: The patient group was composed of 116 patients; 30 obese patients with NAFLD (BMI > 30 kg/m2), 30 patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM)+NAFLD (BMI > 30 kg/m2), 16 patients with NAFLD (BMI < 30 kg/m2), and operated obese group with NAFLD (BMI > 30 kg/m2). The control group comprised 81 non-obese healthy adults. Liver adipose tissue samples were obtained in 30 operated NAFLD patients. HAdV-36-DNA, HAdV-36 neutralizing antibodies, serum lipid, and adipokine levels were analyzed. RESULTS: HAdV-36 neutralizing antibodies (HAdV-36 Ab-positive) were detected in 10/116 and 2/81 participants in the study and control groups, respectively; the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.005). LDL, total cholesterol but not adipokine levels were found to be significantly higher in HadV-36 Ab-positive patients (p < 0.05).

METHODS AND RESULTS: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed and EMBASE, from inception to 6 March 2021, and included all studies reporting the incidence of MI, IS, AF, and HF in patients with and without NAFLD. Random-effect fmodels were used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and 95% prediction intervals (PI); subgroup analyses, meta-regressions, and sensitivity analyses were additionally performed. Among 3254 records retrieved from literature, 20 studies were included. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with an increased risk of MI (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.39-1.99, 95% PI: 0.84-3.30), IS (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.29-1.55, 95% PI 1.03-1.93), AF (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.18-1.37, 95% PI: 1.07-1.52), and HF (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.43-1.84, 95% CI: 1.04-2.51). We identified significant subgroup differences according to geographical location, study design, NAFLD definition, and risk of bias; meta-regressions identified mean age, male sex, and study-level characteristics as potential moderators of the risk of MI and IS.

A detailed questionnaire and the results of abdominal ultrasonography, a standardized 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and blood biochemical examinations were collected. RESULTS: A total of 9927 subjects were included in this study. The prevalence of MAFLD (40.3%) was significantly higher than that of NAFLD (36.9%) (P < 0.05). MAFLD was highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (53.8%), impaired fasting glucose (35.7%) and impaired glucose tolerance (40.9%). High risk of advanced fibrosis based on fibrosis-4 was highly prevalent (14.7%) in lean MAFLD with T2DM. Among 9927 subjects, 3481 (35.1%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MAFLD and NAFLD (MAFLD+NAFLD+), 521 (5.2%) MAFLD+NAFLD-, and 181 (1.8%) MAFLD-NAFLD+. The MAFLD+NAFLD- group had more significant metabolic disorders than those in the MAFLD+NAFLD+ group (all P < 0.05). Among MAFLD-NAFLD+ subjects, 82.9% had metabolic disorders.

Using a diet-induced model of NAFLD and monocarboxylate transporter-1 (Mct1(+/-)) haploinsufficient mice, which resist high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis, we investigated the hypothesis that NAFLD leads to an encephalopathy by altering cognition, behaviour, and cerebral physiology. We also proposed that global MCT1 downregulation offers cerebral protection. METHODS: Behavioural tests were performed in mice following 16 weeks of control diet (normal chow) or high-fat diet with high fructose/glucose in water. Tissue oxygenation, cerebrovascular reactivity, and cerebral blood volume were monitored under anaesthesia by multispectral optoacoustic tomography and optical fluorescence. Cortical mitochondrial oxygen consumption and respiratory capacities were measured using ex vivo high-resolution respirometry. Microglial and astrocytic changes were evaluated by immunofluorescence and 3D reconstructions. Body composition was assessed using EchoMRI, and liver steatosis was confirmed by histology. RESULTS: NAFLD concomitant with obesity is associated with anxiety- and depression-related behaviour. Low-grade brain tissue hypoxia was observed, likely attributed to the low-grade brain inflammation and decreased cerebral blood volume. It is also accompanied by microglial and astrocytic morphological and metabolic alterations (higher oxygen consumption), suggesting the early stages of an obesogenic diet-induced encephalopathy. Mct1 haploinsufficient mice, despite fat accumulation in adipose tissue, were protected from NAFLD and associated cerebral alterations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of compromised brain health in obesity and NAFLD, emphasising the importance of the liver-brain axis. The protective effect of Mct1 haploinsufficiency points to this protein as a novel therapeutic target for preventing and/or treating NAFLD and the associated brain dysfunction. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This study is focused on unravelling the pathophysiological mechanism by which cerebral dysfunction and cognitive decline occurs during NAFLD and exploring the potential of monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) as a novel preventive or therapeutic target. Our findings point to NAFLD as a serious health risk and its adverse impact on the brain as a potential global health system and economic burden. These results highlight the utility of Mct1 transgenic mice as a model for NAFLD and associated brain dysfunction and call for systematic screening by physicians for early signs of psychological symptoms, and an awareness by individuals at risk of these potential neurological effects.

In this study, a natural gallotannin, 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (GA), was isolated from water caltrop pericarp and evaluated for its therapeutic effect on NAFLD. Treatment of GA (15 and 30 mg/kg/day) suppressed the body weight gain (p < 0.001) and ameliorated lipid deposition (p < 0.001) in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. GA was able to alleviate HFD-induced insulin resistance (p < 0.001), oxidative stress (p < 0.001), and inflammation (p < 0.001), thereby restoring the liver function in HFD-induced NAFLD mice. Mechanistically, GA diminished the aberrant signaling pathways including AMPK/SREBP/ACC, IRs-1/Akt, IKK/IkappaB/NF-kappaB in HFD-induced NAFLD mice and modified gut microbiota dysbiosis in these mice as well.

Serologic stress biomarkers were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Multivariate regression showed that waist-to-hip ratio, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, FGF19, adiponectin-to-leptin ratio, insulin, albumin, triglyceride, total-cholesterol, and alanine-aminotransferase were independent predictors of steatosis (rank-ordered by Wald).

METHODS: We implemented an algorithm for all adults with diabetes mellitus in a large primary care practice and excluded hepatitis B and C or alcohol use. Applying annual Fibrosis-4 Index and NAFLD Fibrosis Score for 5 years, we categorized patients as low-risk, indeterminate-risk, or high-risk for advanced fibrosis. We targeted all high-risk and messaged each primary care provider, recommending hepatology linkage. We collected final diagnosis and fibrosis (F0-4) outcomes. Using multivariable logistic regression, we assessed risk factors for advanced fibrosis stage (F3-4). RESULTS: Of 3028 patients, 1018 were low-risk, 577 indeterminate-risk, and 611 high-risk. There were 264 target patients; their 89 primary care providers received a message per patient suggesting hepatology referral. The majority (n=149) were referred; at triage, 118 were deemed likely NAFLD. Of these, 90 completed visits, 78/90 were diagnosed as NAFLD, and 69/78 underwent fibrosis staging, with F3 to 4 in 25/69. In multivariable analysis, hemoglobin A1c >/=8% (OR=7.02, 95% CI: 1.29-38.18) and Fibrosis-4 Index (OR=1.79, 95% CI: 1.07-2.99) were associated with increased risk of F3 to 4. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study testing a case-finding strategy in primary care and almost 1/3 of diabetes mellitus were high-risk for advanced fibrosis. When prompted, 73% of primary care providers placed referrals and 76% of patients completed visits, revealing 86% NAFLD and 36% F3 to 4.

Then, focusing on the genes that were frequently expressed in these diseases, together with GSVA and WGCNA, we utilized a range of analysis methods to identify the main co-expressed genes in both diseases by taking intersections. We investigated these changes after learning that they mostly affected lipid metabolism and oxidative stress injury pathways. RESULTS: By analyzing these genes and their interactions with transcription factors and proteins, we were able to identify 8 genes that share common patterns. From these 8 genes, we were possible to forecast potential future medicines. Our research raises the possibility of NAFLD and sarcopenia transcriptome regulatory pathways in aging populations. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, a complete transcription pattern mapping was carried out in order to identify the core genes, underlying biological mechanisms, and possible therapeutic targets that regulate aging in NAFLD and sarcopenia patients.

In NAFLD, metabolic abnormalities, obesity, and metabolic syndrome are the driving factors for liver damage with no or minimal alcohol consumption. ALD refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake in individuals drinking more than 5 to 10 daily units for years. Although NAFLD and ALD are nosologically considered two distinct entities, they show a continuum and exert synergistic effects on the progression toward liver cirrhosis. The current view is that low alcohol use might also increase the risk of advanced clinical liver disease in NAFLD, whereas metabolic factors increase the risk of cirrhosis among alcohol risk drinkers. Therefore, special interest is now addressed to individuals with metabolic abnormalities who consume small amounts of alcohol or who binge drink, for the role of light-to-moderate alcohol use in fibrosis progression and clinical severity of the liver disease. Evidence shows that in the presence of NAFLD, there is no liver-safe limit of alcohol intake.

It often coexists with hypertension in the context of metabolic syndrome. We investigated the effects of amlodipine on NAFLD combined with hypertension and investigated the underlying mechanism/s. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) and 0.05% N-nitro-L-arginine methylester sterile water to induce NAFLD with hypertension. Gut microbiota composition and function were assessed by 16S ribosomal DNA and metagenomic sequencing. Untargeted metabolome profiles were applied to identify differential metabolites in mice caecum. KEY RESULTS: Amlodipine besylate and amlodipine aspartate significantly decreased liver injury and hepatic steatosis, and improved lipid metabolism with a concomitant reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes in mice with NAFLD and hypertension. Mechanistically, amlodipine besylate and amlodipine aspartate have potential to restore intestinal barrier integrity and improve antimicrobial defence, along with the elevated abundances of Akkermansia, Bacteroides and Lactobacillus. Noteworthily, the gut microbiota in amlodipine besylate- and amlodipine aspartate-treated mice had higher abundance of functional genes involved in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. Consistently, the strengthened taurine and hypotaurine metabolism was confirmed by untargeted metabolome analysis. Based on the correlation and causal analysis, the altered gut microbiota composition and the enhancement of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism may synergistically decreased alanine aminotransferase, liver triglycerides, lipogenic genes and plasma cholesterol in HFD-fed hypertensive mice. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Amlodipine besylate and amlodipine aspartate exert multifactorial improvements in NAFLD and hypertension by modulating gut microbiota.

Considering high prevalence of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and the regulating role of Ism1 on glucose uptake of peripheral tissues, we further explored the association between Ism1 and diabetes-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: A total of 120 newly diagnosed T2D patients and 60 control subjects with normal glucose were recruited in the case-control study. Serum Ism1 concentrations were determined by ELISA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent association of serum Ism1 concentration with the risk of T2D. The 120 newly diagnosed T2D patients were divided into uncomplicated T2D group and diabetes-associated NAFLD group according to the FLI score. RESULTS: The Ism1 level of normoglycemic controls was higher than that of T2D patients (3.91 +/- 0.24 ng/ml vs 3.01 +/- 0.16 ng/ml, P=0.001). Based on quartile analysis of Ism1 level, the proportion of high circulating Ism1 levels in the control group increased while T2D group decreased, and the distribution difference was statistically significant (P=0.015). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the serum Ism1 level was an independent protective factor of type 2 diabetes (OR=0.69, 95%CI: 0.54-0.89). The decrease of Ism1 level did not increase the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in diabetic patients by Binary logistic regression analysis (OR=1.08, 95% CI: 0.69-1.69).

Spleen-strengthening and liver-draining formula (SLF) is a formula formed according to the theory of \"One Qi Circulation\" (Qing Dynasty, 1749) of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has shown significant therapeutic effect in patients with NAFLD in a preliminary clinical observation. In this study, we aim to explore the mechanism of SLF against NAFLD, especially its effect on glucolipid metabolism, from the perspective of intestinal flora. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study was designed to observe the efficacy and safety of SLF in the treatment of NAFLD. The study participants were randomly and evenly divided into control group and treatment group (SLF group). The control group made lifestyle adjustments, while the SLF group was treated with SLF on top of the control group. Both groups were participated in the study for 12 consecutive weeks. Furthermore, the feces of the two groups were collected before and after treatment. The intestinal flora of each group and healthy control (HC) were detected utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the SLF group showed significant improvements in liver function, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and liver stiffness measurement (LSM), meanwhile, patients had significantly lower lipid and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with better security. Intestinal flora 16S rRNA gene sequencing results indicated reduced flora diversity and altered species abundance in patients with NAFLD. At the phylum level, Desulfobacterota levels were reduced. Although Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes did not differ significantly between HC and NAFLD, when grouped by alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in NAFLD, Firmicutes levels were significantly higher in patients with ALT or AST abnormalities, while Bacteroidetes was significantly lower. Clinical correlation analysis showed that Firmicutes positively correlated with gender, age, ALT, AST, LSM, and Fibroscan-AST (FAST) score, while the opposite was true for Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, the levels of Alistipes, Bilophila, Butyricimonas, Coprococcus, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 group Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcus, UCG-002, and UCG-003 were reduced, whereas abundance of Tyzzerella increased. There was no statistically significant difference in Firmicutes and Bacteroidota levels in the SLF group before and after treatment, but both bacteria tended to retrace. At the genus level, Coprococcus (Lachnospiraceae family), Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 group (Lachnospiraceae family), and Ruminococcus (Ruminococcaceae family) were significantly higher in the SLF group after treatment, and there was also a tendency for Bilophila (Desulfovibrionaceae family) to be back-regulated toward HC. CONCLUSIONS: SLF can improve liver function and glucolipid metabolism in patients with NAFLD and lower down liver fat content to some extent. SLF could be carried out by regulating the disturbance of intestinal flora, especially Coprococcus, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 group, and Ruminococcus genus.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36743913/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fendo.2022.1107071", "pt": "Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland"}, {"uid": 36854062, "aid": "01720094-990000000-00134 CTG-22-0344 10.14309/ctg.0000000000000575", "titl": "Digital Therapeutics: Emerging New Therapy for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/therapy/epidemiology;;; Pandemics;;; *COVID-19/epidemiology;;; Life Style;;; Prognosis", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Zhou, Run; Gu, Yunpeng; Zhang, Binbin; Kong, Tingting; Zhang, Wei; Li, Jie; Shi, Junping", "jour": "Clinical and translational gastroenterology", "affl": "College of Nursing, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, China.;;; School of Public Health, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, China.;;; Department of Translational Medicine Platform, The Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, China.;;; Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang, China.;;; College of Nursing, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, China.;;; School of Public Health, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, China.;;; Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Jiangsu, China.;;; Institute of Viruses and Infectious Diseases, Nanjing University, Jiangsu, China.;;; College of Clinical Medicine, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, China.;;; The Department of Hepatology, the Affiliated Hospital & Institute of Hepatology and Metabolic Disease, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, China.", "pdat": "2023 Apr 1", "tiab": "The increased prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) worldwide is particularly worrisome, as no medication has been approved to treat the disease.

For S-Map, the right lobe of the liver was visualized in the section where the heartbeat was detected by right intercostal scanning, a 4 x 2-cm region of interest (ROI) was defined at 5 cm from the liver surface, and ROI strain images were acquired. Measurements were repeated six times, with the average taken as the S-Map value. Correlations of S-Map and SWE values with fibrosis stage determined by liver biopsy were analyzed using multiple comparisons. The diagnostic performance of S-Map for fibrosis staging was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: In total, 107 patients (65 men, 42 women; mean age 51 +/- 14 years) were analyzed. The S-Map value by fibrosis stage was 34.4 +/- 10.9 for F0, 32.9 +/- 9.1 for F1, 29.5 +/- 5.6 for F2, 26.7 +/- 6.0 for F3, and 22.8 +/- 4.19 for F4.

It is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, and patients with NAFLD often have comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. In addition to liver-related complications, NAFLD has been associated with a range of non-liver comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality in patients with NAFLD, and patients with NAFLD have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease than the general population. Chronic kidney disease is also more common in patients with NAFLD, and the severity of NAFLD is associated with a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Sleep apnea, a disorder characterized by breathing interruptions during sleep, is also more common in patients with NAFLD and is associated with the severity of NAFLD.

The leading cause of death in NAFLD is of cardiac etiology being ischemic heart disease. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: NAFLD is associated with several CV complications including cardiac structural and functional alterations. However, there are no current approved pharmacotherapies for treating NAFLD, leading to increased CV risk with an increasing morbidity and mortality. DATA SOURCES: We summarize the currently available therapeutic strategies in managing NAFLD and their cardioprotective effects according to recently published data, guidelines, and practice guidance recommendations. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Several therapeutic modalities evaluated in NAFLD include nonpharmacological strategies, pharmacotherapies and surgical management. Nonpharmacological strategies are recommended in early stages of NAFLD and include weight loss, physical activity, and dietary changes. Personalized management strategies with nonpharmacological lifestyle modifications are associated with reduced CV risk, improved liver enzyme levels, in addition to liver fat content, injury, and fibrosis. Several pharmacotherapies including lipid-lowering agents and antidiabetic drugs such as insulin sensitizers and incretin mimetics, in addition to antioxidants, ursodeoxycholic acid, semi-synthetic bile acid analogue, acetylsalicylic acid, and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors have been evaluated in the current literature. Despite promising results of several drugs in NAFLD with cardioprotective effects, we currently remain with no approved medical drugs for treating NAFLD. Although bariatric surgery was demonstrated to be associated with CV risk reduction and improvements in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, it remains of limited use because of its invasiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Management of NAFLD necessitates a multidisciplinary team with a patient-centered and individualized medicine approach.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed patients with pathologically proven NAFLD who underwent liver MRI. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data (including FIB-4 scores) were gathered. The SAF score was used to assess NAFLD. MRI-proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and LSN were determined on pre-contrast MR sequences. ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI-LSN for the diagnosis of advanced (F3-F4) liver fibrosis. RESULTS: The final population included 142 patients. Sixty-seven (47%) patients had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 52 (37%) had advanced fibrosis. The median MRI-PDFF increased with the grades of steatosis: 8.1%, 18.1%, and 31% in S1, S2, and S3 patients, respectively (p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of MRI-LSN >/= 2.50 was 0.838 (95%CI 0.767-0.894, sensitivity 67.3%, specificity 88.9%, positive and negative predictive values 77.8% and 82.5%, respectively) for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis. Combining FIB-4 and MRI-LSN correctly classified 103/142 (73%) patients. This was validated in an external cohort of 75 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MRI-LSN has good diagnostic performance in diagnosis of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients. A combination of FIB-4 and MRI-LSN derived from pre-contrast MRI could be helpful to detect advanced fibrosis.

Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and triglyceride-glucose (TyG) Index, are surrogate scores developed in the first place for noninvasive assessment of steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

METHODS: The cohort included 814 patients with CHC infection in whom liver biopsy was performed. After implementing strict criteria for sample adequacy and necessary data, 424 patients were finally enrolled in our study. Histological findings were used as a reference point, and surrogate scores HSI and TyG index were expressed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in order to assess their ability in determining patients without (<5%) or with steatosis (>5%), but also to address their ability in assessing between different degrees of steatosis. RESULTS: The average age of study population was 37.09 years and the majority of patients were men (67%). Liver steatosis was detected in approximately half of the liver biopsy samples (50.4%). About 5% of them had severe steatosis. The area under the ROC curve values for HSI and TyG index when detecting liver steatosis were 0.76 and 0.629, respectively.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly relevant in the development of metabolic risk factors that have been associated with antipsychotic treatment. We aimed to assess the incidence of NAFLD and metabolic disturbances during the first 3 years of antipsychotic treatment in patients with first episode of psychosis (FEP), and compare it with the incidence in a control group. METHODS: Data were obtained from patients with psychosis (n = 160) and healthy controls (n = 66) included in the Cantabria's clinical and research program on FEP (PAFIP) from 2012 to 2018. Fatty Liver Index (FLI) was used to estimate the amount of fat in the liver. FLI has been validated for the diagnosis of NAFLD against different standards such as liver ultrasound and biopsy. FLI and metabolic parameters were registered at baseline, 3 months and then yearly for 3 years. RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up (3-years), 21.9 % of patients with psychosis developed a FLI >/= 60, suggestive of liver steatosis, compared to only a 3 % of subjects within the control group (X(2) = 12.120; p < 0.001). In the FEP patients group, developing a FLI >/= 60 was statistically associated with significant increments in metabolic parameters, and with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) (X(2) = 16.151; p < 0.001) and high blood pressure (X(2) = 10.654; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Having a first episode of non-affective psychosis was significantly associated with developing liver steatosis (FLI >/= 60) in the first three years after initiating antipsychotic treatment.

The aim of this study was to evaluate CLD and CLD management awareness among diabetologists and GPs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to diabetologists within the Francophone Diabetes Society and to GPs in southern and western France. The questionnaire sounded participant characteristics and knowledge of CLD and its management. RESULTS: 678 questionnaires were completed by 500 GPs and 178 diabetologists. CLD prevalence was underestimated by 90% of GPs and 59% of diabetologists (p<0.001). For biological CLD follow-up, liver injury explorations (transaminases) were systematically included whereas severity explorations (prothrombin time, bilirubin) were prescribed for less than 50% of blood samples; GPs were more likely to prescribe severity explorations than diabetologists were (p<0.001). 74% of GPs and 97% of diabetologists (p<0.001) were familiar with non-invasive tests, Fibroscan and Fibrotest being the two most-frequently mentioned of them. In contrast, the simple blood test Fibrosis-4 was cited by less than 15% of GPs and 30% of diabetologists (p<0.001).

Furthermore, we explored the relationship of Hcy with liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). METHODS: Two-sample Mendelian randomisation study was conducted. Summary statistics for Hcy were obtained from a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analysis comprising 44,147 subjects.

On baseline Fibroscan, 59% had F0-2 fibrosis and 70% had moderate-severe steatosis. 33 patients completed the study. Median percentage of days with valid FitBit data collection was 91. 4 patients increased and maintained, 19 maintained, and 8 increased but subsequently returned to baseline weekly step count. 59% of patients reported Fitbit was easy to use and 66% felt step count feedback motivated them to increase their activity. Roughly 50% of patients had reduction in weight, triglycerides and Fibroscan liver stiffness, and 75% had improvement in controlled attenuation parameter and physical function. CONCLUSIONS: A 6-month mobile-technology based pilot lifestyle intervention was feasible and acceptable to NAFLD patients.

The present study aimed to evaluate the temporal effect of isocaloric high-sugar diet (HSD) intake on the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the role of DNA methylation in this event. Newly weaned Wistar rats were divided into eight groups and fed a standard chow diet or an HSD ad libitum for 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 15 weeks, and 18 weeks. After the experimental periods, the animals were euthanized and their livers were removed for histological analysis, gene expression of maintenance methylase (Dnmt1), de novo methylases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b), demethylases (Tet2 and Tet3) of DNA, and global DNA methylation. HSD intake led to the gradual development of NAFLD. HSD intake for 18 weeks was associated with downregulation of Dnmt1 expression and global DNA hypomethylation; these results were negatively correlated with more severe steatosis scores observed in these animals. The HSD consumption for 18 weeks was also associated with a decrease in Dnmt3a and Tet2 expression. Interestingly, the expression of de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3b was reduced by HSD during all experimental periods. Together, these results indicate that the downregulation of de novo DNA methylation, Dnmt3b, induced by HSD is the primary factor in the development of NAFLD. On the other hand, disease progression is associated with downregulation of maintenance DNA methylation and global DNA hypomethylation. These results suggest a link between the dynamic changes in hepatic DNA methylation and the development of NAFLD induced by an HSD intake.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35716250/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1007/s13105-022-00900-w https://sci-hub.do/10.1007/s13105-022-00900-w", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Spain"}, {"uid": 36411436, "aid": "10.1186/s12876-022-02575-5 2575 10.1186/s12876-022-02575-5", "titl": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are associated with high FIB-4 index in a health checkup examination cohort without known liver disease.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology;;; Retrospective Studies;;; *Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis/epidemiology;;; Liver Cirrhosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/complications;;; *Hypertension/epidemiology/complications", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Sato, Shunsuke; Kawai, Hidehiko; Sato, Sho; Iwasaki, Hirohiko; Omori, Masashi; Kita, Yuji; Ikeda, Yuji; Awatsu, Takahito; Murata, Ayato; Taniguchi, Gentaro; Shimada, Yuji; Genda, Takuya", "jour": "BMC gastroenterology", "affl": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan. syusato@juntendo.ac.jp.;;; Fuji Town Medical Center, 12-12 Fujicho, Shizuoka, Fuji, 416-0915, Japan.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan.;;; Fuji Town Medical Center, 12-12 Fujicho, Shizuoka, Fuji, 416-0915, Japan.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital, 1129 Nagaoka, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 410-2295, Japan.", "pdat": "2022 Nov 21", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is usually asymptomatic and lacks a specific biomarker; therefore, many individuals might remain undiagnosed even with advanced liver fibrosis.

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 6,087 subjects without known liver disease who had participated in an annual health checkup examination. We analyzed the factors associated with high FIB-4 index (>/= 2.67) using a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 6,087 subjects, 76 (1.2%) had high FIB-4 index. Multivariate analysis identified hypertension (odds ratio [OR]; 9.040; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.081-20.024; P < 0.001) and diabetes mellitus (OR = 4.251; 95% CI, 1.773-10.193; P = 0.001) as important risk factors for high FIB-4 index. The rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in subjects with high FIB-4 index were 78.9% and 23.7%, respectively. No significant association was observed between obesity or large waist circumference and high FIB-4 index. A history of cardiovascular disease was significantly more common in subjects with high FIB-4 index. These results were also observed in subjects with normal liver function test. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that approximately 1% of the general Japanese population has a high risk of advanced liver fibrosis.

It is acknowledged that exercise is one of the optimal non-pharmacological methods for preventing and treating NAFLD. Different forms of exercise such as aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and even simply physical activity in a higher level can be beneficial in reducing liver lipid accumulation and disease progression for NAFLD patients. In NAFLD patients, exercise is helpful in lowering steatosis and enhancing liver function. The mechanisms underlying the prevention and treatment of NAFLD by exercise are various and complex. Current studies on the mechanisms have focused on the pro-lipolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant and lipophagy. Promotion of lipophagy is regarded as an important mechanism for prevention and improvement of NAFLD by exercise. Recent studies have investigated the above mechanism, yet the potential mechanism has not been completely elucidated. Thus, in this review, we cover the recent advances of exercise-promoted lipophagy in NAFLD treatment and prevention.

Given the significance of the LKB1/AMPK pathway in metabolic homeostasis, this study aims to investigate its role in 6-gingerol-induced mitigation on NAFLD. Our study showed that 6-gingerol ameliorated hepatic steatosis, inflammation and oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro. Further experiment validation suggested that 6-gingerol activated an LKB1/AMPK pathway cascade in vivo and in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the 6-gingerol-elicited activation of an LKB1/AMPK pathway cascade was related to the enhanced stability of the LKB1/STRAD/MO25 complex. Furthermore, radicicol, an LKB1 destabilizer, inhibited the activating effect of 6-gingerol on an LKB1/AMPK pathway cascade via destabilizing LKB1/STRAD/MO25 complex stability in vitro, thus reversing the 6-gingerol-elicited ameliorative effect. In addition, molecular docking analysis further predicated the binding pockets of LKB1 necessary for binding with 6-gingerol.

METHODS: We used 40 male rats (Wistar) divided into the following groups: Control (A) (n=8), induced MS (B) (n=8), MS + atorvastatin treatment (C)(n=8), MS + metformin treatment (D) (n=8) and MS + combined treatment (E) (n=8). MS was induced by administering 10% fructose in drinking water for 45 days. Atorvastatin 0.035 mg/day/rat, metformin 1.78 mg/day/rat, and a combination of both drugs were administered for 45 days. Metabolic, oxidative (nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase and superoxide dismutase) and inflammatory (fibrinogen) parameters were determined. Histological sections of liver were analyzed by light microscopy. RESULTS: The glycemia, lipid profile and TG/HDL-C index were altered in MS group. After pharmacological treatment, metabolic parameters improve significantly in all treated groups. Inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers increase in MS. Treated groups showed an increase in NO bioavailability, no difference in MPO activity and an increase in fibrinogen.

As Mendelian randomisation (MR) avoids many limitations of conventional observational studies, this two-sample bidirectional MR analysis was conducted to determine the following: (i) whether genetically predicted 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are a risk factor for NAFLD, and (ii) whether genetic risk for NAFLD influences 25(OH)D levels. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with serum 25(OH)D levels were obtained from the European ancestry-derived SUNLIGHT consortium. SNPs associated with NAFLD or NASH (p-value < 1 x 10(-5)) were extracted from previous studies and supplemented by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) performed in the UK Biobank. These GWASs were done both without (primary analysis) and with (sensitivity analysis) the population-level exclusion of other liver diseases (e.g., alcoholic liver diseases, toxic liver diseases, viral hepatitis, etc.). Subsequently, MR analyses were performed to obtain effect estimates using inverse variance weighted (IVW) random effect models. Cochran's Q statistic, MR-Egger regression intercept, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) analyses were used to assess pleiotropy. No causal association of genetically predicted serum 25(OH)D (per standard deviation increase) with risk of NAFLD was identified in either the primary analysis: n = 2757 cases, n = 460,161 controls, odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.95 (0.76, -1.18), p = 0.614; or the sensitivity analysis.

This article reviews the pathogenic interrelationship between NAFLD and dyslipidemia, elucidates underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and focuses on management approaches for dyslipidemic patients with NAFLD. RECENT FINDINGS: Atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD results from hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance along with associated alterations of hepatic glucose and lipoprotein metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and genetic factors. Since atherogenic dyslipidemia and NAFLD share a bi-directional relationship and are both major driving forces of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) development, early detection and adequate treatment are warranted. Thus, integrative screening and management programs are urgently needed.

Mounting preclinical evidence indicates liver inflammation may play a major role in steatosis development and fibrosis but has not garnered the same clinical representation. This may be owing to deficiencies in standard therapeutic modalities that limit their application in NAFLD. RNA interference (RNAi) is an attractive approach to targeting liver inflammation owing to its clinical safety profile, target specificity, and limited biodistribution. In this study, we characterize a simple cholesterol-short-interfering RNA (siRNA) conjugate system targeting Tnf mRNA in liver macrophages for the treatment of NAFLD. First, we observed delivery and anti-inflammatory activity in an acute liver inflammation model. In a follow-up murine NAFLD model, we observed total prevention of nearly all hallmarks of this disease: steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.

Ultrasound (US) is used for NAFLD and hepatic steatosis (HS) grading. The most popular US method for NAFLD assessment is the hepatorenal index (HRI), but because of its limitations, other noninvasive methods have been developed. The Resona 7 US system has recently incorporated an US attenuation-related quantitative feature, liver ultrasound attenuation (LiSA), for HS estimation. The purpose of this study is to compare LiSA's and HRI's performance on NAFLD assessment. METHODS: A total of 159 NAFLD patients having a magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) examination were examined by 2 radiologists, who performed LiSA and HRI measurements in the liver. Correlation of LiSA's and HRI's measurements with MRI-PDFF values was calculated through Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). To further investigate the performance of LiSA and HRI, optimum cutoffs, provided by the literature, were used to correspond HS grades to MRI-PDFF results. Moreover, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on LiSA measurements and steatosis grades was performed. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging-PDFF was better correlated with LiSA (PCC = 0.80) than HRI (PCC = 0.67). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed better performance range for LiSA (77.8%-91.8%) than for HRI (72.8%-85.4%) on all HS grades for all studies used for corresponding MRI-PDFF values to HS grades.

The fibrosis-8 (FIB-8) score, recently developed by incorporating four additional variables into the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, showed better performance in predicting significant fibrosis in NAFLD. AIM: To validate the FIB-8 score in a biopsy-proven NAFLD cohort and compare the diagnostic performance of the FIB-8 and FIB-4 scores and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) for predicting significant fibrosis. METHODS: We collected the data of biopsy-proven NAFLD patients from three Asian centers in three countries. All the patients with available variables for the FIB-4 score (age, platelet count, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels) and FIB-8 score (the FIB-4 variables plus 4 additional parameters: The body mass index (BMI), albumin to globulin ratio, gamma-glutamyl transferase level, and presence of diabetes mellitus) were included. The fibrosis stage was scored using nonalcoholic steatohepatitis CRN criteria, and significant fibrosis was defined as at least fibrosis stage 2. RESULTS: A total of 511 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and complete data were included for validation. Of these 511 patients, 271 (53.0%) were female, with a median age of 51 (interquartile range: 41, 58) years. The median BMI was 29 (26.3, 32.6) kg/m(2), and 268 (52.4%) had diabetes. Among the 511 NAFLD patients, 157 (30.7%) had significant fibrosis (>/= F2). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the FIB-8 and FIB-4 scores and NFS for predicting significant fibrosis were 0.774, 0.743, and 0.680, respectively. The FIB-8 score demonstrated significantly better performance for predicting significant fibrosis than the NFS (P = 0.001) and was also clinically superior to FIB-4, although statistical significance was not reached (P = 0.073). The low cutoff point of the FIB-8 score for predicting significant fibrosis of 0.88 showed 92.36% sensitivity, and the high cutoff point of the FIB-8 score for predicting significant fibrosis of 1.77 showed 67.51% specificity. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the FIB-8 score had significantly better performance for predicting significant fibrosis in NAFLD patients than the NFS, as well as clinically superior performance vs the FIB-4 score in an Asian population.

However, it remains controversial as to whether nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) shows reduced circulating (serum/plasma) irisin levels. A meta-analysis was conducted to address this issue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search of databases was performed up to June 2021. Observational studies that reported circulating irisin in NAFLD ascertained by any methods (e.g. ultrasonography or magnetic resonance) and compared with any controls were eligible for inclusion. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using a random-effects meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Eleven studies enrolling 1277 NAFLD cases and 944 non-NAFLD controls were included. The approaches used for NAFLD ascertainment included ultrasonography (4 studies), magnetic resonance (3 studies), and liver biopsy (5 studies). Meta-analysis showed that circulating irisin in NAFLD was comparable to any non-NAFLD controls (10 studies with 11 datasets; SMD -0.09, 95% CI: -0.48 to 0.29), including the body mass index (BMI)-matched and lean controls (both p >/= 0.80). Restricting studies to NAFLD ascertained by magnetic resonance or liver biopsy rather than ultrasonography showed that serum irisin was reduced in NAFLD (5 studies, SMD -0.63, 95% CI: -1.14 to -0.13). Meta-analysis also suggested that circulating irisin did not differ between mild and moderate-to-severe NAFLD (7 studies; SMD 0.02, 95% CI: -0.25 to 0.30), and this association was not significantly moderated by study location (Europe versus Asia).

METHODS: We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase databases until July 2022 for relevant studies. The robust error meta-regression method was used to investigate the dose-response association between the TyG index and NAFLD.

RESULTS: A total of 4 cohort and 8 cross-sectional studies were included, with 28,788 NAFLD cases among the 105,365 participants. A positive association for the risk of NAFLD was observed for each additional unit of the TyG index with a linear association (p=0.82), and the summary OR was 2.84 (95% CI, 2.01-4.01).

Diet influences the progression of NAFLD; following a western diet or simply a high-fat diet may contribute to the worsening of NAFLD and further progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis in later stages. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet is the gold standard for both the treatment and prevention of NAFLD. Social behaviours, such as smoking, caffeine consumption and physical activity also play a role in the pathophysiology of NAFLD.

This study investigates fatty liver disease at the intersection of donor and recipient. A retrospective review of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation database identified 5167 NASH and 26,289 non-NASH transplant recipients who received transplants from January 1, 2004, to June 12, 2020. A total of 12,569 donors had allografts with no macrosteatosis (<5%), 16,140 had mild macrosteatosis (5%-29%), and 2747 had moderate to severe macrosteatosis (>/=30%). Comparing recipients with NASH to propensity score-matched (PSM) recipients without NASH demonstrated noninferior graft and patient survival up to 10 years in patients with NASH. Similar trends were observed in subgroup analyses of transplants within each strata of allograft macrosteatosis. Assessing allograft macrosteatosis specifically in the NASH population demonstrated that allografts with >/=30% macrosteatosis were associated with reduced early graft survival (30 days, 93.32% versus 96.54% [P = 0.02]; 1 year, 84.53% versus 88.99% [P = 0.05]) compared with PSM grafts with <30% macrosteatosis. Long-term graft survival at 5 and 10 years, however, was similar. The use of carefully selected macrosteatotic allografts can be successful in both recipients with NASH and recipients without NASH. The metabolic environment of patients with NASH does not appear to adversely affect outcomes with regard to the allograft when controlled for numerous confounders.

We describe the prevalence and features of cognitive dysfunction and examine the associations between cognitive dysfunction and the presence and severity of NAFLD, and the associations between cognitive dysfunction and signs of other obesity-related comorbidities and neuronal damage. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients with a body mass index of 35 kg/m2 underwent evaluation for bariatric surgery. They were screened for adiposity-related comorbidity and underwent a liver biopsy and basic cognitive testing with the Continuous Reaction Time test, the Portosystemic Encephalopathy Syndrome test, and the Stroop Test.

The results showed that the administration of NKK20 ameliorated hepatocyte fatty degeneration, reduced total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and alleviated inflammatory reactions in NAFLD mice. In addition, the 16S rRNA sequencing results indicated that NKK20 could decrease the abundance of Pseudomonas and Turicibacter and increase the abundance of Akkermansia in NAFLD mice. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that NKK20 could significantly increase the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon contents of mice. The obtained non-targeted metabolomics results revealed a significant difference between the metabolites in the colon contents of the NKK20 administration group and those in the high-fat diet group, in which a total of 11 different metabolites that were significantly affected by NKK20 were observed, and these metabolites were mainly involved in bile acid anabolism. UPLC-MS technical analysis revealed that NKK20 could change the concentrations of six conjugated and free bile acids in mouse liver. After being treated with NKK20, the concentrations of cholic acid, glycinocholic acid, and glycinodeoxycholic acid in livers of the NAFLD mice were significantly decreased, while the concentration of aminodeoxycholic acid was significantly increased.

In comparison, eight-week-old adult mice were fed with HFF or ND for 12 weeks. BAs were measured in six different anatomical sites to evaluate the systematic changes of BAs within the enterohepatic circulation. The dysregulated BA metabolism had occurred in HFF after 4-week intervention, represented by increased primary BAs and decreased hyocholic acid (HCA) species. After 12 weeks, the impact was more significant with increased secondary BA synthesis and excretion, particularly for lithocholic acid (LCA) species. More interestingly, the BA changes were more significant in younger mice in response to 12-week diet intervention.

METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 61 patients with NAFLD, age 55.9 +/- 15.6 y, were randomly divided into two groups: FO (3 g/d; n = 30) and corn oil (CO; 3 g/d; n = 31), which served as the control group. RESULTS: After a 3-mo intervention, there were significant net reductions in serum alanine transaminase (-5.4 +/- 14.5 U/L vs. -0.25 +/- 4.70 U/L; P = 0.001) and triacylglycerol (-0.70 +/- 1.10 mmol/L vs. 0.11 +/- 1.04 mmol/L; P = 0.018) levels in the FO group compared with the CO group.

Here we aimed to determine the impact of Hmgcs2-mediated ketogenesis and its modulations on the development and treatment of fatty liver disease. METHODS: Loss- and gain-of-ketogenic function models, achieved by Hmgcs2 knockout and overexpression, respectively, were utilized to investigate the role of ketogenesis in the hepatic lipid accumulation during postnatal development and in a high-fat diet-induced NAFLD mouse model. RESULTS: Ketogenic function was decreased in NAFLD mice with a reduction in Hmgcs2 expression. Mice lacking Hmgcs2 developed spontaneous fatty liver phenotype during postnatal development, which was rescued by a shift to a low-fat dietary composition via early weaning. Hmgcs2 heterozygous adult mice, which exhibited lower ketogenic activity, were more susceptible to diet-induced NAFLD development, whereas HMGCS2 overexpression in NAFLD mice improved hepatosteatosis and glucose homeostasis.

The Joinpoint Regression model and Gaussian process regression were, respectively, used to estimate the annual percentage change in prevalence rates and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates, and the relationship between the sociodemographic index (SDI) and age-standardized rates of LC-NAFLD. RESULTS: In 2019, China had 293.42 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 263.69-328.44) LC-NAFLD cases with a prevalence rate and DALYs of 20.63 (95% UI: 23.09-18.54) per 1000 people and 591.03 thousand (95% UI: 451.25-737.33), respectively.

Along with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), NAFL is a type of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Currently, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide. A wide range of comorbidities that can increase the risk of NAFLD includes obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to discover genetic variants for NAFL in the Korean population. METHODS: Differing from previous studies, we conducted a genome-wide association study for NAFL in the selected subjects without comorbidities to rule out bias due to the inclusion of confounding effects of comorbidities. We grouped 424 NAFL cases and 5,402 controls from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) subjects without comorbidities such as dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. All subjects including cases and controls did not consume alcohol at all, or consumed less than 20 g/day for men and less than 10 g/day for women. RESULTS: The logistic association analysis adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and waist circumference identified one novel genome-wide significant variant (rs7996045, P = 2.3 x 10(-8)) for NAFL. This variant was located in the intron of CLDN10 and was not detected using previous conventional approaches in which confounding effects resulting from comorbidities were not considered in the study design stage. In addition, we detected several genetic variants showing suggestive association for NAFL (P < 10(-5)).

The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with NAFLD and its association with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. METHODS: 9145 participants 40 years or older attended a mobile examination center visit in the 1999-2004 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.90 in either of the legs and mortality data through December 2015 were obtained from the National Death Index. NAFLD was defined by a fatty liver index >/= 60 in the absence of other liver conditions, leading to a final sample of 3094 subjects. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of PAD was 5.9% (95% CI 5.0-6.9). Over a median follow-up of 13 years, 876 participants died, 208 of cardiovascular causes. Incidence rates of all-cause mortality (for 1000 person-years) were 20.2 (95% CI 18.7-21.7) and 70.0 (95% CI 60.1-81.6) for participants without and with PAD, respectively. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models showed that PAD was associated with a higher risk of all-cause (1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.4) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.3) after adjustment for potential confounders including prevalent CVD.

METHODS: The study was conducted based on data collected from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during the period 2005-2014. A total of 13 837 and 6 177 participants aged > 20 years were eligible for conducting the Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI) and the US Fatty Liver Index (USFLI) analysis, respectively. RESULTS: From 2005-2014, a downward trend in femoral neck BMD was observed in subjects with NAFLD aged >/= 40.

We evaluated the association of rs10487505 with leptin levels, liver histology, and surgery-induced weight loss in youths with NAFLD. METHODS: One-hundred five obese youths with NAFLD, of whom 19 undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), were analyzed for rs10487505 and leptin circulating levels. RESULTS: The G allele frequency was lower in youths with NAFLD than in controls (p = 0.049). No difference was found in anthropometrics, biochemistry and histology between G allele carriers and CC homozygotes, except for leptin levels (p = 0.016). Leptin correlated with body weight, BMI, BMI-z score, waist circumference, insulin resistance/sensitivity, and triglycerides (p </= 0.01). A multivariable regression model including body weight and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was a good predictor of plasma leptin (R(2) = 0.45), and the addition of genotype to the model increased the R(2) to 0.50. Following LSG, leptin levels and body weight were more reduced in G allele carriers (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: LncOb rs10487505 variant was associated with pediatric NAFLD and high leptin levels, and with weight and leptin reduction after LSG in youths.

However, due to oxidative stress, disease-associated upregulation of murine CYP3A11 activity can contribute to unexpected drug metabolism and disposition, which could seriously hinder the efficacy of LY294002 and oridonin. Nanotechnology-based effective reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers have emerged as a promising strategy to overcome these limitations. In this study, a rationally designed ROS-responsive liposome loaded with oridonin and LY294002 (RLLs) was developed for effective liver deposition and metabolic regulation for NAFLD treatment. First, we ascertained that the insulin resistance-induced signaling response was balanced by the combination of LY294002 and oridonin. Then, the particle size, zeta potential, ROS-responsive release behavior, and ROS-scavenging properties were investigated. Moreover, the CCl(4)-exposed mouse model was used to assess the biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy of RLLs on NAFLD. Finally, the \"multiple crosstalk\" modulation of RLLs was explored by western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and polymerase chain reaction analysis. RLLs exhibited antioxidant efficacy for the safe delivery of LY294002 and oridonin with good stability and biocompatibility. The biodistribution analysis proved that the accumulation of RLLs was significantly increased due to CD44-mediated targeting.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and related influencing factors of NAFLD in school-aged children and adolescents in Shenyang, Liaoning Province. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between lifestyle and fatty liver. METHODS: We conducted aprospective cohort study of 1309 school-aged children and adolescents between the ages of 7 and 18 years who underwent physical examination from November to December 2019. In addition, they were collected age, gender, learning stage, height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-hip ratio. Finally, a portion of the population was selected to complete a questionnaire survey to explore the impact of lifestyle habits on fatty liver disease. RESULTS: NAFLD was present in 23.83% of subjects. The prevalence of children and adolescents was 22.73% and 24.43%, respectively. Fatty liver prevalence differs significantly by gender and learning stages. The highest rate of fatty liver was seen in obese children (71.68%). Moreover, exercise, diet, and parental factors can affect children with fatty liver. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD is very prevalent in children and adolescents in Shenyang city. Due to the close relationship between NAFLD and obesity, lifestyle plays a major role in the occurrence of NAFLD.

Subjects with the phenotype known as metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) meet most of the MS cardiometabolic risk criteria and show a higher risk of advanced NAFLD severity, compared with the so-widely known metabolically healthy obese (MHO). Obese individuals with MS are more susceptible to abnormal lipid accumulation in different tissues, whereas oxidative stress and nitrogen metabolites are increased in MS and/or obesity. This study aimed to explore whether plasma- or liver tissue-determined biomarkers of nitrogen metabolism and oxidative stress relate to NAFLD severity and/or metabolic phenotype. Methods: This cross-sectional study included candidates for bariatric surgery with biopsy-proven NAFLD diagnosis and staging. For comparison, the study population was divided according to NAFLD damage (steatohepatitis F0-F1 vs. steatohepatitis F2-F4) and metabolic phenotype (MHO vs MUO, based on the MS criteria). Hepatic and plasma concentrations of nitrogen metabolites and oxidative stress biomarkers were determined by enzymatic kinetics assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Greiss reaction. Results: The study population (N = 45) was constituted by patients with obesity and higher prevalence of dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. According to plasma biomarkers, MUO phenotype was related to higher cardiometabolic risk; meanwhile, advanced NAFLD damage was related to higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and triglycerides. Elevated hepatic concentrations of ammonium, nitrites, arginine, and citrulline were found in MUO phenotype, but only higher plasma concentration of malondialdehyde was found as specifically related to advanced NAFLD damage.

The gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy, but this is seldom achieved due to costs and risk for side effects, and that is why the diagnosis is mostly made based on a combination of radiology and exclusion of other liver diseases. Disease severity staging can be noninvasively achieved with radiological exams such as elastography or blood-based markers that usually have lower sensitivity and specificity. NAFLD is today the most common chronic liver disease globally with a prevalence estimated to be 25%. Fortunately, for many persons NAFLD is an incidental finding with a good prognosis. Whilst a major focus has been on liver-related outcomes in NAFLD, there has recently been an increased interest in extrahepatic consequences of NAFLD. The most commonly studied outcomes include cardiovascular disease and cancer. The risk of adverse outcomes generally differs according to the baseline fibrosis stage. There is a five-time higher risk of liver-related events in NAFLD patients with fibrosis stage 3 as compared to those with no or little fibrosis. Meanwhile, the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) does not seem to influence prognosis in addition to fibrosis stage. Patients with NAFLD clearly have a higher risk for cardiovascular outcomes compared to the general population, with a recent meta-analysis indicating a 37% increased hazard for cardiovascular events as opposed to individuals without NAFLD. The risk of liver cancer is increased, which is mostly driven by presence of cirrhosis, but the increased risk is present also in patients without cirrhosis, and to a greater extent than for other chronic liver disease. Around one-third of patients with NAFLD and liver cancer do not have cirrhosis. Additionally, the risk of extrahepatic malignancies is thought to be moderately increased, with most evidence for a link between NAFLD and colorectal cancer where the risk is approximately 50% higher compared to patients without NAFLD. A particularly salient point is if NAFLD can be considered an independent risk factor for outcomes. Many studies have not been able to adjust for key confounders, or suffer from different forms of bias. The clinical problem is nevertheless to identify persons with an increased risk for adverse hepatic and extrahepatic outcomes.

To study clinical, biochemical, and instrumental features of the course of liver disease in CHC patients with concomitant non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tested 339 patients with chronic hepatitis C with concomitant NAFLD; and 175 patients with capital ES, Cyrilliccapital EN, Cyrilliccapital ES, Cyrillic. Methodology: anamnestic, anthropometric and clinical, general clinical, biochemical, serological, and molecular genetic (markers of hepatitis C virus, HCV RNA PCR (qualitative and quantitative determination, genotyping), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ultrasonographic examination of digestive organs, statistical methods. RESULTS: Conducted clinical, instrumental, and laboratory studies have shown that CHC patients with concomitant NAFLD are characterized by various disorders - a violation of the functional state of the liver, a violation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, an imbalance of the cytokine system, the presence of histological and non-inflammatory activity in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of concomitant NAFLD in patients with CHC aggravates the clinical picture, manifesting itself in a significant lipid metabolism disorder that provokes the rapid formation of liver fibrosis.

Hence, the main objective of this population-based longitudinal cohort study was to evaluate the bidirectional association between psoriasis and NAFLD. METHODS: Data were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with new-onset NAFLD and psoriasis were respectively enrolled in two cohorts. For each comparison cohort, propensity-score-matched controls with no record of NAFLD or psoriasis were selected. An adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was applied to evaluate subsequent risks. RESULTS: The risk of patients with new-onset NAFLD developing psoriasis was statistically significant, with an HR of 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.14). For younger patients with NAFLD, the risk of developing psoriasis was 1.3-fold higher. The risk of patients with new-onset psoriasis developing NAFLD in the future was 1.28-fold higher than that of patients without psoriasis (95% CI, 1.21-1.35), and patients in younger psoriasis subgroups below the age of 40 years were at a higher risk than those in older subgroups, with an aHR of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.40-1.71).

These are some of the common features of ALD progression in ASH (alcoholic steatohepatitis) and NAFLD to NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). Hepatic steatosis, followed by fibrosis, lead to a continuous progression accompanied by angiogenesis. This process creates hypoxia, which activates vascular factors, initiating pathological angiogenesis and further fibrosis. This forms a vicious cycle of ongoing damage and progression. This condition further exacerbates liver injury and may contribute to the development of comorbidities, such as metabolic syndrome as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. Increasing evidence suggests that anti-angiogenic therapy may have beneficial effects on these hepatic disorders and their exacerbation.

Natural plant alkaloids have demonstrated great potential for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. However, the role of rhynchophylline (RHY) in lipid metabolism is not clear. We explored the role of RHY in lipid metabolism in cells treated with oleic and palmitic acids to mimic high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. RHY attenuated oleic and palmitic acid-induced increases in triglyceride accumulation in HepG2, AML12, and LMH cells. RHY also increased energy metabolism and reduced oxidative stress. We further investigated the effect of RHY on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice fed an HFD including 40 mg/kg RHY. RHY alleviated hepatic steatosis, reduced fat deposition, promoted energy metabolism, and improved glucose metabolism.

The pathology of NAFLD was simulated by feeding mice with an HFD in the present study, followed by treating the HFD mice with 150 and 300 mg/kg/day Pirfenidone once a day.

This study aimed to explore the direct, indirect and combined effects of Mediterranean diet, NAFLD and inflammation on the 10-year CVD risk in a healthy adult population. METHODS: Using baseline and 10-year follow-up data from the ATTICA study, adherence to Mediterranean diet was measured using MedDietScore, and presence of NAFLD at baseline was assessed using the fatty liver index (FLI). Participants' 10-year CVD outcomes were recorded and C-reactive protein (CRP) was used as a surrogate marker for inflammation. The direct and indirect roles of these factors were explored using logistic regression models and the pathways between them were analysed using a structural equation model (SEM). RESULTS: NAFLD prevalence was 22.9% and its presence was 17% less likely for every unit increase in MedDietScore. NAFLD presence at baseline was associated with increased 10-year CVD incidence (39.4% vs. 14.5%, p = 0.002), but when adjusted for MedDietScore, NAFLD was not an independent predictor of 10-year CVD risk. MedDietScore was an independent protective factor of 10-year CVD risk (OR = 0.989, 95% CI: 0.847, 0.935), when adjusted for NAFLD at baseline, age, gender, sedentary lifestyle and other confounders. Further exploration using SEM showed that MedDietScore was associated with CVD risk directly even when inflammation as CRP was introduced as a potential mediator. CONCLUSION: FLI as a proxy measure of NAFLD is a strong predictor of 10-year CVD risk, and this prognostic relationship seems to be moderated by the level of adherence to Mediterranean diet.

METHODS: The randomized controlled clinical trial was performed on 87 overweight or obese patients with NAFLD, including intervention (n = 42) and control (n = 45) groups. The intervention received 8 training sessions based on theory of planned behavior (TPB), while the control groups received nutritional and physical activity recommendations from their internal specialist and nutritionist. Analyses were carried out based on data collected from TPB constructs and anthropometric indices (weight, body mass index (BMI), waist size, and waist-hip ratio (WHR)) at three stages (before intervention and two and 12 weeks after the intervention), as well as data obtained from liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), and ultrasound-based grading of NAFLD at two stages (before and 12 weeks after the intervention). RESULTS: After the intervention, a significant difference was found between the intervention and control groups, resulting in the increased mean scores of TPB constructs, decreased liver enzymes, and decreased degree of NAFLD ultrasound. In addition, the intervention group experienced more activity and healthy diet as compared with the control group.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver diseases characterized by the presence of ectopic fat in the liver and steatosis, which cannot be explained by alcohol consumption. The association between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is well established. As liver fibrosis progresses in a patient with NAFLD, insulin resistance (IR) increases and may worsen diabetes control. The aspartate aminotransferase platelet ratio index (APRI) score is a simple and inexpensive bedside marker that can detect liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Several studies have shown an association between APRI and NAFLD. However, there is a gap in correlation with IR in patients with diabetes. In this study, we sought to correlate IR and NAFLD in diabetes using the APRI score. Methods. This observational hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of General Medicine, one of the tertiary care hospitals in North India, from February 2019 to July 2020. A total of 70 patients were taken for the study. Patients with T2DM, aged >30 years, who had no history of alcohol use and who had or were newly diagnosed with NAFLD were enrolled in the study. Results. Significant differences in mean HbAc1, AST, serum insulin, APRI score and homeo-static model assessment-2 (HOMA2) IR between NAFLD grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 groups were found. Pearson correlation between APRI score and HOMA2 IR total values revealed a significant positive correlation between them. Conclusions.

The obese mice received MET (230 mg/kg), PCA (200 mg/kg) monotherapies, and MET combination with PCA in the diet for 10 weeks. Our results showed that the combination of MET and PCA markedly ameliorated weight gain and fat deposition in HFD fed mice. Furthermore, the combination of MET and PCA lowered liver triglyceride (TG) content which was accompanied by decreased expression of lipogenic and increased expression of beta-oxidation related genes and proteins. In addition, combination therapy of MET and PCA mitigated liver inflammation through inhibiting hepatic macrophage infiltration (F4/80), switching macrophage from M1 into M2 phenotype, and ameliorating nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity in comparison with the monotherapy of MET or PCA. Furthermore, we found that MET and PCA combination therapy upregulated thermogenesis-related genes in BAT and sWAT. Combination therapy results in stimulating brown-like adipocyte (beige) formation in the sWAT of HFD mice.

Therefore, early detection and quantified measurement of hepatic fat content are of great importance. Liver biopsy is currently the most accurate method for the evaluation of hepatic steatosis. However, liver biopsy has several limitations, namely, its invasiveness, sampling error, high cost and moderate intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility. Recently, various quantitative imaging techniques have been developed for the diagnosis and quantified measurement of hepatic fat content, including ultrasound- or magnetic resonance-based methods. These quantitative imaging techniques can provide objective continuous metrics associated with liver fat content and be recorded for comparison when patients receive check-ups to evaluate changes in liver fat content, which is useful for longitudinal follow-up.

However, it is unclear whether NAFLD contributes independently to the development of CV disease. Our study aimed at assessing the differences in several indices of atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and cardiac morphology among patients with isolated NAFLD, isolated hypertension (HT) or a combination of the two conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 169 participants (mean age = 50.4 +/- 10.2 yrs; males = 73.6%) were divided according to the presence of NAFLD and HT into three groups: only NAFLD (55 patients), only HT (49 patients), and NAFLD + HT (65 patients). Exclusion criteria were a BMI>/=35 kg/m(2) and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Carotid ultrasonography was performed to measure markers of atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Cardiac remodeling was analyzed using echocardiography. The prevalence of subclinical and overt atherosclerosis was significantly higher in the NAFLD + HT patients as compared to the other two groups (atherosclerotic plaques: 43.1%, 10.9%, and 22.4% (p < 0.001) in NAFLD + HT, NAFLD, and HT groups, respectively). No differences were found among indices of arterial stiffening and cardiac remodeling across the three groups. In multivariate regression analysis, the coexistence of NAFLD and HT was an independent risk factor for overt atherosclerosis (OR = 4.88, CI 95% 1.14-20.93), while no association was found when either NAFLD or HT was considered alone. CONCLUSION: Overt atherosclerosis was significantly present only in NAFLD + HT patients, but not in patients with isolated NAFLD.

However, research exploring the association between blood glucose management and the risk of NAFLD status in subjects without diabetes was insufficient. This study aimed to explore the association of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with NAFLD status and the severity of liver steatosis and fibrosis in non-diabetic people. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 2998 non-diabetic American adults using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-2018 cycle. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the association between HbA1c and NAFLD status and the severity of liver steatosis and fibrosis. Interaction and stratified analyses were additionally performed. RESULTS: The multivariate regression analyses showed that HbA1c was associated independently with NAFLD status in all the models (model1: OR = 2.834, 95%CI: 2.321, 3.461; model 2: OR = 2.900, 95%CI: 2.312, 3.637 and model 3: OR = 1.664, 95%CI: 1.284, 2.156). We further performed the interaction and stratified analyses and discovered a significant interaction between HbA1c and BMI (P(interaction) < 0.05). Finally, a robust link was shown between HbA1c level and the severity of liver steatosis, which was mainly significant in the prediabetes group, while the correlation was not significant in HbA1c level and severity of liver fibrosis after controlling for all the potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that HbA1c level was positively correlated to the risk of developing NAFLD in a large non-diabetic American population.

Whether this results in an increased risk for dementia remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the association of NAFLD and fibrosis with incident dementia and cognition among the elderly. METHODS: We performed longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses within the Rotterdam Study, an ongoing prospective cohort. Participants visiting between 1997 and 2002 with available fatty liver index (FLI) (set 1) or participants visiting between 2009 and 2014 with abdominal ultrasound (set 2) and liver stiffness (set 3) were included. Exclusion criteria were secondary causes for steatosis, prevalent dementia, and missing alcohol data. NAFLD was defined as FLI >/=60 or steatosis on ultrasound and fibrosis as liver stiffness >/=8.0 kPa. Dementia was defined according to the DSM-III-R. Associations between NAFLD, fibrosis, or liver stiffness and incident dementia were quantified using Cox regression. Finally, the association between NAFLD and cognitive function was assessed cross-sectionally. RESULTS: Set 1 included 3,975 participants (age 70 years, follow-up 15.5 years), set 2 4,577 participants (age 69.9 years, follow-up 5.7 years), and set 3 3,300 participants (age 67.6 years, follow-up 5.6 years). NAFLD and fibrosis were consistently not associated with an increased risk for dementia (NAFLD based on ultrasound, hazard rate [HR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.61-1.16; NAFLD based on FLI, HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69-1.22; fibrosis, HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.58-1.99) in fully adjusted models. Of interest, NAFLD was associated with a significantly decreased risk for incident dementia until 5 years after FLI assessment (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.24-0.94). Moreover, NAFLD was not associated with worse cognitive function, covering several domains. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD and fibrosis were not associated with an increased risk for incident dementia, nor was NAFLD associated with impaired cognitive function. In contrast, NAFLD was even protective in the first 5 years of follow-up, hinting toward NAFLD regression before dementia onset.

The remarkable effects of corn peptides (CPs) as bioactive peptides on liver protection have attracted much attention. Nevertheless, the specific effect of CPs on NAFLD remains unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the efficacy of CPs in the prevention and auxiliary treatment of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD in SD rats, and puerarin was used as the positive control. SD rats were fed a high-fat diet to establish the NAFLD rat model, and LO2 cells were treated with a high concentration of fructose to simulate the NAFLD cell model. NAFLD was comprehensively examined in terms of body weight, liver function markers, serum biochemistry and liver histology. Protein expression was determined using western blot analysis. The results of animal experiments showed that CPs could effectively inhibit the rate of weight gain, reduce the blood lipid level and liver index, and enhance glucose tolerance. The results of cell experiments showed that CPs could effectively reduce the accumulation of lipids in LO2 cells and inhibit the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, CPs could markedly reduce liver lipid accumulation in the liver cell and liver tissue, as further evidenced by the reduced expression of SREBP-1c in human non-tumour hepatic (LO2) cells. Meanwhile, the increased expression of SIRT1/PPAR-alpha and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways under the pretreatment of CPs in LO2 cells indicated that CPs could markedly relieve high fat-induced fatty liver injury, regulate insulin sensitivity, and reduce production of ROS. The results of in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that CPs provided potential prevention and auxiliary treatment for NAFLD through reducing lipid accumulation, alleviating insulin resistance, and inhibiting oxidative stress.

This study aimed to examine the prognostic accuracy of NITs for liver-related mortality (LRM) and events (LREs) in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: We investigated 1313 patients with NAFLD. Patients were assigned to low-risk, indeterminate-risk, and high-risk groups using conventional cutoff values of each FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) and to stage 0-2 and stage 3-4 groups using the fibrosis stage. Survival and Cox regression analyses of the prognostic potential of NITs for LRM/LREs were conducted. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 4.5 years, regarding to FIB-4, the incidence rate (/1000 person-years) in the low risk was zero for LRM and 0.5 for LREs. In contrast, the rate in stage 0-2 was 1.3 for LRM and 2.8 for LRE. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for LREs in the high risk compared with the low risk were 32.85 (P < 0.01). The aHRs in stage 3-4 compared with stage 0-2 were 2.68 (P = 0.02) for LREs and 2.26 (P = 0.582) for LRM. In the same fibrosis stage, the incidence of LRM/LREs was more frequent with a higher risk stratification. The same trend was observed for NFS. CONCLUSIONS: NITs accurately predict LRM and LREs as well as a liver biopsy in Japanese patients with NAFLD. Patients in the low risk may not require close follow-up for at least 5 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 44 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). They were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin 10 mg/day or sitagliptin 100 mg/day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS). The secondary endpoints included intramuscular and extramuscular lipid content seen in (1) H-MRS, body composition seen through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity shown through hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp using stable isotopic glucose. Liver biopsy samples were pathologically evaluated at baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes, HbA1c level and IHL were 3.7 years, 7.2% and 20.9%, respectively. The median NAFLD activity score was 3.0. IHL was significantly more decreased in the empagliflozin group than that in the sitagliptin group (between-group difference was -5.2% +/- 1.1% and -1.9% +/- 1.2%, respectively, (95% confidence interval); -3.3 (-6.5, -0.1), P = .044). However, there were no significant between-group differences in the change of insulin sensitivity in the liver, muscle or adipose tissues.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We implemented ML models including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network to predict histological stages of fibrosis using 17 demographic/clinical features in 1370 patients with NAFLD who underwent liver biopsy, FibroScan, and labs within a 6-month period at multiple U.S. centers. Histological stages of fibrosis (>/=F2, >/=F3, and F4) were predicted using ML, FibroScan liver stiffness measurements, and Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4). NASH with significant fibrosis (NAS >/= 4 + >/=F2) was assessed using ML, FibroScan-AST (FAST) score, FIB-4, and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). We used 80% of the cohort to train and 20% to test the ML models. For >/=F2, >/=F3, F4, and NASH + NAS >/= 4 + >/=F2, all ML models, especially RF, had primarily higher accuracy and AUC compared with FibroScan, FIB-4, FAST, and NFS. AUC for RF versus FibroScan and FIB-4 for >/=F2, >/=F3, and F4 were (0.86 vs. 0.81, 0.78), (0.89 vs. 0.83, 0.82), and (0.89 vs. 0.86, 0.85), respectively. AUC for RF versus FAST, FIB-4, and NFS for NASH + NAS >/= 4 + >/=F2 were (0.80 vs. 0.77, 0.66, 0.63). For NASH + NAS >/= 4 + >/=F2, all ML models had lower/similar percentages within the indeterminate zone compared with FIB-4 and NFS. Overall, ML models performed better in sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value compared with traditional noninvasive tests.

However, it is not clear whether NAFLD changes sleep traits or whether the changes in sleep traits lead to the onset of NAFLD. The purpose of this study was to investigate the causal relationship between NAFLD and changes in sleep traits using Mendelian randomization. METHODS: We proposed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and performed validation analyses to dissect the association between NAFLD and sleep traits. Genetic instruments were used as proxies for NAFLD and sleep. Data of genome-wide association study(GWAS) were obtained from the center for neurogenomics and cognitive research database, Open GWAS database and GWAS catalog. Three MR methods were performed, including inverse variance weighted method(IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median. RESULTS: In total,7 traits associated with sleep and 4 traits associated with NAFLD are used in this study. A total of six results showed significant differences. Insomnia was associated with NAFLD (OR(95% CI)= 2.25(1.18,4.27), P = 0.01), Alanine transaminase levels (OR(95% CI)= 2.79(1.70, 4.56), P =4.71x10-5) and percent liver fat(OR(95% CI)= 1.31(1.03,1.69), P = 0.03). Snoring was associated with percent liver fat (1.15(1.05,1.26), P =2x10-3), alanine transaminase levels (OR(95% CI)= 1.27(1.08,1.50), P =0.04).And dozing was associated with percent liver fat(1.14(1.02,1.26), P =0.02).For the remaining 50 outcomes, no significant or definitive association was yielded in MR analysis. CONCLUSION: Genetic evidence suggests putative causal relationships between NAFLD and a set of sleep traits, indicating that sleep traits deserves high priority in clinical practice. Not only the confirmed sleep apnea syndrome, but also the sleep duration and sleep state (such as insomnia) deserve clinical attention. Our study proves that the causal relationship between sleep characteristics and NAFLD is the cause of the change of sleep characteristics, while the onset of non-NAFLD is the cause of the change of sleep characteristics, and the causal relationship is one-way.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37334291/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fendo.2023.1159258", "pt": "Journal Article;

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are becoming a cornerstone in the management of cardiovascular health and some studies suggest the potential role in NAFLD. However, patients under treatment with SGLT2i are at risk of developing genitourinary fungal infections (GFIs). Moreover, both NAFLD and SGLT2i have a strong influence on the immune system, and therefore the risk of infections other than GFIs could be increased in NAFLD patients treated with SGLT2i. We aimed to examine the possible association of SGLT2i with infections and hepatic outcomes in NAFLD patients. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study including NAFLD patients with T2DM visited at the Liver Unit outpatient clinic from 2016 to 2021 with a minimum follow-up of 6 months by selecting 65 patients receiving SGLT2i and 130 matched patients with other types of antidiabetic treatment. RESULTS: During follow-up, GFIs were significantly higher in the SGLT2i group (15.4% vs. 3.8%; p=0.008), whereas there were no differences in the occurrence of overall infections (41.5% vs. 30%; p=0.1) nor in other types of specific infections. In the multivariable analysis, treatment with SGLT2i was not independently associated with higher odds of overall infection. On the other hand, SGLT2i patients showed a significantly lower incidence of hepatic events (1.5% vs. 10.7%; p=0.02). There were no significant different in all-cause mortality between cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD patients with T2DM receiving SGLT2i more frequently presented GFIs, whereas the incidence of other types of infections was not found to be higher than in other patients with NAFLD and T2DM treated with other drugs. Moreover, SGLT2i-treated patients had a lower occurrence of hepatic events.

Despite its epidemic proportions, there is no reliable diagnostics that generalizes to global patient population for distinguishing NASH from NAFLD. We performed a comprehensive multicohort analysis of publicly available transcriptome data of liver biopsies from Healthy Controls (HC), NAFLD and NASH patients. Altogether we analyzed 812 samples from 12 different datasets across 7 countries, encompassing real world patient heterogeneity. We used 7 datasets for discovery and 5 datasets were held-out for independent validation. Altogether we identified 130 genes significantly differentially expressed in NASH versus a mixed group of NAFLD and HC. We show that our signature is not driven by one particular group (NAFLD or HC) and reflects true biological signal.

DESIGN: Patients with high ALT and with a diagnosis of fatty liver were included in this cross-sectional study. Fasting blood was collected to test biomarkers and SNPs. A total of 266 patients underwent MRI-PDFF and FibroScan examinations, and 38 underwent liver biopsy. Diagnostic models (decision tree, LASSO, and elastic net) were developed based on the diagnosis from MRI-PDFF reports. RESULTS: Approximately, 1/3 of the patients were found to have NASH and fibrosis. After quantifying liver steatosis by MRI-PDFF (healthy: n = 47; mild NAFLD: n = 136; moderate/severe NAFLD: n = 83; liver fat content (LFC): 3.6% vs. 8.7% vs. 19.0%), most biomarkers showed significant differences among the three groups, and patients without obesity were found to have a similar LFC as those with obesity (11.1% vs. 12.3%). Models including biomarkers showed strong diagnostic ability (accuracy: 0.80-0.91). Variant alleles of PNPLA3, HSD17B13 and MBOAT7 were identified as genetic risk factors causing higher LFC (8.7% vs. 12.3%; 11.0% vs. 14.5%; 8.5% vs. 10.2%, p < 0.05); those with the UQCC1 rs878639 variant allele showed lower LFC (10.4% vs. 8.4%; OR = 0.58, p < 0.05). Patients with more risk alleles had higher LFCs (8.1% vs. 10.7% vs. 11.6% vs. 14.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on MRI-PDFF, a combination of several specific biomarkers can accurately predict disease status.

RESULTS: 428 patients were included in this analysis, 63% were male and median age was 37.9 years (30.0-44.0). 54% patients rated \"to help others\" and 30% \"to improve my health status\" as the greatest benefit from CTs. The most important concerns were safety (43%) and patients' benefit (26%). Improving liver fibrosis or cirrhosis (53%) and reducing fat in liver (21%) were desired efficacy of new drugs. Possibility of being treated with a placebo for up to 2-6 years played an influential (21%) or very influential (73%) role on participation. Lower education level, lower body mass index, and cirrhosis were positively associated with acceptance of liver biopsies.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study including 1,587,962 individuals from 19 health check-up centers in China from 2009-2017 and a longitudinal study with 16,112 individuals. A logistic regression model was applied to determine the association between hyperuricemia and MAFLD in a cross-sectional study. The Cox regression model was used to explore the association between hyperuricemia at baseline and subsequent onset of MAFLD or the association between the presence of MAFLD at baseline and the subsequent incidence of hyperuricemia. The cross-lagged analysis was applied to exam the temporal relationship between hyperuricemia and MAFLD. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, hyperuricemia showed a strong positive association with MAFLD after controlled potential confounders. In the longitudinal cohorts, hyperuricemia at baseline was associated with the new-onset of MAFLD, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.765 (95% CI: 1.512, 2.060). Interestingly, baseline MAFLD was also associated with the subsequent incidence of hyperuricemia, with an HR of 1.245 (95% CI: 1.106, 1.400).

We measured dietary intake information using a validated food frequency questionnaire and determined diet quality based on the alternate healthy eating index-2010(AHEI-2010). The score of HLS was calculated based on four lifestyle factors, including a healthy diet, normal body weight, non-smoking, and high physical activity. An ultrasound scan of the liver was used to detect NAFLD in participants of the case group. Logistic regression models were used to determine the odds ratios(ORs) and 95% confidence interval(CI) of NAFLD across tertiles of HLS and AHEI. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD age of the participants were 38.13 +/- 8.85 years. The Mean +/- SD HLS in the case and control groups was 1.55 +/- 0.67 and 2.53 +/- 0.87, respectively.

The zebrafish administered with high-dose VitD (1.25 mug) had significantly reduced liver fat compared to those that received low-dose VitD (0.049 mug) or caloric restriction. Gene expression analysis revealed that VitD downregulated several pathways that may play a role in NAFLD etiology, which affected fatty acid metabolism, vitamins and their cofactors, ethanol oxidation, and glycolysis. The pathway analysis revealed that the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and the isoprenoid biosynthetic process pathway were significantly upregulated whereas the small molecule catabolic process pathway significantly downregulated following the exposure of NAFLD zebrafish model to high VitD dose.

Defects in function/expression of genes/proteins are critical in initiation/progression of NAFLD. Natural products may modulate these genes/proteins.

Here, bioinformatic tools, gene-drug and gene-disease databases were utilized to explore targets, interactions, and pathways through which curcumin could impact NAFLD. METHODS: Significant curcumin-protein interaction was identified (high-confidence:0.7) in the STITCH database. Identified proteins were investigated to determine association with NAFLD. gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were analyzed for significantly involved targets (p < 0.01). Specificity of obtained targets with NAFLD was estimated and investigated in Tissue/Cells-gene associations (PanglaoDB Augmented 2021, Mouse Gene Atlas) and Disease-gene association-based EnrichR algorithms (Jensen DISEASES, DisGeNET). RESULTS: Two collections were constructed: 227 protein-curcumin interactions and 95 NAFLD-associated genes. By Venn diagram, 14 significant targets were identified, and their biological pathways evaluated. Based on gene ontology, most targets involved stress and lipid metabolism. KEGG revealed chemical carcinogenesis, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications and NAFLD as the most common significant pathways.

NAFLD defines a spectrum of progressive liver conditions ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which often occur in close and bidirectional associations with metabolic disorders. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by anatomic and/or functional renal damage, ultimately resulting in a reduced glomerular filtration rate. The physiological axis linking the liver and kidneys often passes unnoticed until clinically significant portal hypertension, as a major complication of cirrhosis, becomes apparent in the form of ascites, refractory ascites, or hepatorenal syndrome. However, the extensive evidence accumulated since 2008 indicates that noncirrhotic NAFLD is associated with a higher risk of incident CKD, independent of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other common renal risk factors. In addition, subclinical portal hypertension has been demonstrated to occur in noncirrhotic NAFLD, with a potential adverse impact on renal vasoregulation. However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unexplored to a substantial extent. With this background, in this review we discuss the current evidence showing a strong association between NAFLD and the risk of CKD, and the putative biological mechanisms underpinning this association. We also discuss in depth the potential pathogenic role of the hepatorenal reflex, which may be triggered by subclinical portal hypertension and is a poorly investigated but promising research topic.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of foetal exposure to famine as a risk factor for developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adulthood. METHODS: Studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases to evaluate the effect of foetal exposure to famine on the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adulthood. RESULTS: Six studies involving 90,582 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Foetal exposure to famine was associated with an increased risk of NAFLD(RR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.08-1.27, P < 0.0001). Exposure to famine during the foetal period significantly increased the incidence of NAFLD in women (RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.16-1.40, P <0.00001), while similar results were not observed in the male subgroup (RR =0.99, 95% CI: 0.89-1.11, P = 0.88).

However, muscle alterations in early stage NAFLD remain unclear. METHODS: Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or early nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without significant fibrosis were selected from a prospective biopsy-proven NAFLD cohort (N = 338). The skeletal muscle index and mean muscle attenuation (MA) were measured using abdominal fat computed tomography at the third lumbar vertebra level. Severe myosteatosis was defined as the lowest quartile of sex-stratified MA values. RESULTS: Patients with early NASH (n = 87) had lower MA (45.61 +/- 6.45 vs 47.48 +/- 5.85 HU; P = .028) than patients with NAFL (n = 251) but a similar skeletal muscle index. Patients with more severe lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning had lower MA (P = .003 and P = .041, respectively). The severe myosteatosis prevalence was higher in early NASH than in NAFL (33.3% vs 21.1%; P = .029). Patients with severe myosteatosis were more likely to have early NASH in multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, and metabolic factors (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24-4.86), which was maintained after adjustment for visceral fat amount (odds ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.22-4.89).

However, the relationship of NFS with PCSK9 and their prognostic abilities in cardiovascular risks are unknown. METHODS: A total of 2008 hospitalized subjects who had chest pain without lipid-lowering therapy were consecutively included. Baseline clinical data were collected, and the NFS was calculated. The circulating PCSK9 concentration was determined by enzyme immunoassay. The major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) occurrences were recorded in the follow-up period. Associations of PCSK9 concentration with NFS were examined. All of the participants were categorized into three groups according to NFS levels and were further stratified by PCSK9 tertiles to evaluate the MACEs. RESULTS: 158 (7.87%) MACEs were observed during a mean of 3.2 years of follow-up. NFS levels were independently related to higher PCSK9 levels according to multivariable linear regression analysis. Furthermore, elevated PCSK9 and NFS concentrations were respectively associated with increased MACE incidence in multivariable Cox regression models. When combining NFS status with PCSK9 tertiles as a stratifying factor, patients with intermediate-high NFS and high PCSK9 levels had higher risks of events than those with low NFS and low PCSK9 levels.

Endocrinologists are in a unique position to prevent cirrhosis in this population with early diagnosis and treatment. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to offer endocrinologists a practical approach for the management of patients with NAFLD, including diagnosis, fibrosis risk stratification, and referral to hepatologists. PATIENTS: (1) An asymptomatic patient with obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors, found to have hepatic steatosis; (2) a patient with T2D and NASH with clinically significant liver fibrosis; and (3) a liver transplant recipient with a history of NASH cirrhosis, with significant weight regain and with recurrent NAFLD on the transplanted organ. CONCLUSION: NASH can be reversed with proper management of obesity and of T2D. While no agents are currently approved for the treatment of NASH, treatment should include lifestyle changes and a broader use of structured weight-loss programs, obesity pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Diabetes medications such as pioglitazone and some glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists may also improve liver histology and cardiometabolic health. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and insulin may ameliorate steatosis, but their effect on steatohepatitis remains unclear.

To explore factors independent of obesity that may be involved in the occurrence of NAFLD, we performed an iTRAQ-based proteomic study to identify proteins differentially expressed in serum between NAFLD and MHO subjects.

Recent studies suggested a controversial role of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in the development of NAFLD. Here, we showed that as an immune regulator, STING aggravates the progression of NAFLD in diet-induced mice and correlated it with the changes in hepatic lipid metabolism and gut microbiota diversity. After feeding wild-type (WT) and STING deletion mice with a normal control diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD), the STING deletion mice showed decreased lipid accumulation and liver inflammation compared with WT mice fed the same diet. In addition, STING specifically produced this hepatoprotective effect by inhibiting the activation of CD8(+) T cells. The gut microbiota analysis revealed significant differences in intestinal bacteria between STING deletion mice and WT mice under the same diet and environmental conditions; moreover, differential bacterial genera were associated with altered metabolic phenotypes and involved in related metabolic pathways.

Patients exhibiting the inflammatory subtype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are at increased risk of liver-related complications. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the prevalence of NASH with significant fibrosis in PWH using noninvasive tests (NITs). DESIGN: In this prospectively enrolling cohort study, 282 PWH were explored for hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and steatohepatitis using vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and the Fibroscan-AST (FAST) score. METHODS: On the basis of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; dB/m) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM; kPa), patients were categorized according to the presence of steatosis (>/=275 dB/m) and significant fibrosis (>/=8.2 kPa). The FAST score was calculated according to established cut-offs. RESULTS: The prevalence of hepatic steatosis in this cohort was 35.5% ( n  = 100) with 75 (75%) of these patients fulfilling the criteria of NAFLD. The prevalence of significant fibrosis (>/= F2) was 6.7% ( n  = 19). The FAST score identified a total of 32 (12.3%) patients with a cut-off greater than 0.35, of whom 28 (87.5%) PWH qualified as NASH. On multivariable analysis, waist circumference was a predictor of hepatic steatosis and type 2 diabetes was a predictor of significant fibrosis. Type 2 diabetes and ALT remained independent predictors of a FAST score greater than 0.35. CONCLUSION: NASH with significant fibrosis is highly prevalent among PWH.

The Fatty Liver Index was used to identify the participants with NAFLD. RESULTS: Of all participants, 1550 (33.6%) met the NAFLD criteria. In subjects of both genders with NAFLD, the mean values of the QTc interval were considerably higher than in those without NAFLD (p < .001). After adjusting for a wide range of confounders, including age, gender, smoking status, physical activity, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, diabetes, and hypertension status, in linear regression analysis, the standardized beta coefficient of QTc interval among participants with NAFLD was 2.56 ms (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-4.64). After controlling the same confounders, the odds ratio of NAFLD for a prolonged QTc interval in men was 1.47 (95% CI: 1.18-1.84; p < .001) and in women was 1.39 (95% CI: 1.15-1.68; p < .001) using logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD was a risk factor for QTc interval prolongation.

Recently, many researchers have reported that the mega-dose vitamin C treatment had positive effects on various diseases. However, the precise relationship between mega-dose vitamin C and NAFLD has not been completely elucidated. This study has been designed to discover the effects of mega-dose vitamin C on the progression of NAFLD. Twelve-week-old wild-type C57BL6 mice were fed chow diets and high-fat and high-fructose diet (fast-food diet) ad libitum for 11 weeks with or without of vitamin C treatment. Vitamin C was administered in the drinking water (1.5 g/L). In this study, 11 weeks of the mega-dose vitamin C treatment significantly suppressed the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) independently of the catabolic process. Vitamin C supplements in fast-food diet fed mice significantly decreased diet ingestion and increased water intake. Histopathological analysis revealed that the mice fed a fast-food diet with vitamin C water had a mild renal injury suggesting osmotic nephrosis due to fructose-mediated purine derivatives.

Genecards database was used to obtain NAFLD-related genes. Next, the protein-protein interaction network and key ingredients-genes network were constructed via Cytoscape3.7.0. Based on the Metascape website, gene ontology function analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were carried out for key genes. Finally, molecular docking was performed to present the interaction between components and genes using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2. RESULTS: Eighteen active ingredients and 10 target genes were screened from Ginkgo Folium. AKT1, TNF, EGFR, PTGS2, MAPK8, PPAgamma, APP, ESR1, HIFalpha and PPAalpha were considered as potential therapeutic targets. These target genes were mainly enriched in insulin resistance, HIF-1, adipocytokine and AMPK signaling pathways. Molecular docking results suggested that Ginkgo Folium active ingredients including luteolin-4'-glucoside, sesamin, luteolin, chryseriol, isorhamnetin and laricitrin showed strong binding capacities with AKT1.

However, no drug is available to target NAFLD-HCC. In this study, we aim to unravel novel therapeutic targets of NAFLD-HCC utilizing a high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 screening strategy. We utilized the Epi-drug CRISPR/Cas9 library consisting of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting over 1,000 genes representing the FDA-approved drug targets and epigenetic regulators to perform loss-of-function screening in two NAFLD-HCC cell lines (HKCI2 and HKCI10). CRISPR/Cas9 library screening unraveled TUBB4B as an essential gene for NAFLD-HCC cell growth. TUBB4B was overexpressed in NAFLD-HCC tumors compared with adjacent normal tissues (N = 17) and was associated with poor survival (p < 0.01). RNA-sequencing and functional assays revealed that TUBB4B knockout in NAFLD-HCC promoted cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cellular senescence, leading to suppressed NAFLD-HCC growth in vitro and in vivo. We identified that TUBB4B inhibitor mebendazole (MBZ), an FDA-approved drug, inhibited NAFLD-HCC growth by inducing apoptosis and cellular senescence. Since protein expression of pro-survival Bcl-xL was induced in TUBB4B knockout NAFLD-HCC cells, we examined combination of TUBB4B inhibition with navitoclax, a Bcl-xL inhibitor that selectively targets senescent cells. Consistent with our hypothesis, either TUBB4B knockout or MBZ synergized with navitoclax to inhibit NAFLD-HCC cell growth via the induction of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. In summary, TUBB4B is a novel therapeutic target in NAFLD-HCC. Inhibition of TUBB4B with MBZ in combination with navitoclax synergistically inhibited NAFLD-HCC cell growth, representing a promising strategy for the treatment of NAFLD-HCC. (c) 2023 The Authors.

We investigated the association between exercise training and the achievement of validated thresholds of MRI-measured treatment response. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials in adults with NAFLD were identified through March 2022. Exercise training was compared with no exercise training. The primary outcome was >/=30% relative reduction in MRI-measured liver fat (threshold required for histologic improvement in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis activity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis resolution, and liver fibrosis stage). Different exercise doses were compared. RESULTS: Fourteen studies (551 subjects) met inclusion criteria (mean age 53.3 yrs; body mass index 31.1 kg/m 2 ). Exercise training subjects were more likely to achieve >/=30% relative reduction in MRI-measured liver fat (odds ratio 3.51, 95% confidence interval 1.49-8.23, P = 0.004) than those in the control condition. An exercise dose of >/=750 metabolic equivalents of task min/wk (e.g., 150 min/wk of brisk walking) resulted in significant treatment response (MRI response odds ratio 3.73, 95% confidence interval 1.34-10.41, P = 0.010), but lesser doses of exercise did not. Treatment response was independent of clinically significant body weight loss (>5%). DISCUSSION: Independent of weight loss, exercise training is 3 and a half times more likely to achieve clinically meaningful treatment response in MRI-measured liver fat compared with standard clinical care. An exercise dose of at least 750 metabolic equivalents of task-min/wk seems required to achieve treatment response.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of baicalin on oxidative stress in a new tissue-engineered liver model of NAFLD. The 3D model of NAFLD was induced by a fat-supplemented medium (fatty acids, FFA group) for 8 days and baicalin was administered on the 5th day. CCK-8 assay showed that baicalin at concentrations below 100 muM had no obvious cytotoxicity. Baicalin inhibited apoptosis and lactate dehydrogenase release in the FFA group. Baicalin reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde induced by FFA, and increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione amounts. However, it did not upregulate nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 compared with the FFA group.

METHODS: AYAs (age 15-39 years) with valid FibroScan((R)) measurements in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2017-2018) were included in the analyses. Those with viral hepatitis, pregnancy, or ALT/AST > 500 U/L were excluded. The population was divided into those with excessive alcohol consumption (ALQ130) and those without. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score >/= 248 dB/m was used to identify suspected ALD and NAFLD. In those with evidence of ALD, the following cutoffs of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) were used for suspected fibrosis: F >/= F2 at LSM >/= 7.5 kPa and F >/= F3 at >/= 9.5 kPa, respectively. In those with suspected NAFLD, the following LSM cutoffs were used: F >/= F2 at 6.1 and F >/= F3 at >/= 7.1, respectively. Cutoffs were chosen based on published literature to maximize sensitivity. RESULTS: Comparing to those without, subjects with excessive alcohol consumption tended to be older (29.8 vs 28.5 years), have a higher BMI (29.3 vs 28.9 kg/m2), and be from a White ethnicity (65.3% vs. 55.4%). In subjects with excessive alcohol consumption, suspected ALD was present in 56.59% (95% CI 41.57-70.49). In those with suspected ALD, suspected significant fibrosis (F >/= F2) was present in 12.3% (95% CI 4.74-28.34) and advanced fibrosis (F >/= F3) was present in 6.31% (95% CI 0.69-39.55). Similarly, in subjects without excessive alcohol consumption, suspected NAFLD was present in 40.04% (36.64-43.54). In those with suspected NAFLD, suspected significant fibrosis (F >/= F2) was present in 31.07% (27.25-35.16) and suspected advanced fibrosis (F >/= F3) was present in 20.15% (16.05-24.99).

Currently, moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) are two effective treatments for reducing fat mass in patients with obesity and NAFLD. However, the comparative fat-reducing effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of MICT and HIIT remain unclear. This comprehensive study was performed on male Wistar rats treated with standard diet, high-fat diet, MICT, and HIIT to explore their comparative fat-reducing effects and corresponding molecular mechanisms. HIIT had a greater effect on hepatic vacuolation density and lipid content reduction than MICT, and triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in the serum and the liver demonstrated different sensitivities to different exercise training programs. At the molecular level, both MICT and HIIT altered the processes of fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid transport, fatty acid beta-oxidation, and cholesterol synthesis, wherein the transcriptional and translational levels of signaling molecules peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) regulating fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis were strongly changed. Moreover, the metabolic pathways of amino acids, bile acids, and carbohydrates were also affected according to transcriptome analysis, and the changes in the above-mentioned processes in the HIIT group were greater than those in the MICT group. In combination with the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins (STRING) analysis and the role of PPARs in lipid metabolism, as well as the expression pattern of PPARs in the MICT and HIIT groups, the MICT-and HIIT-induced fat loss was mediated by the PPAR pathway, causing feedback responses in fatty acid, steroid, amino acid, bile acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, and HIIT had a better fat-reducing effect, which may be initiated by PPAR-alpha.

METHODS: Over 6 months, 552 patients with NAFLD underwent liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by both 2D-SWE and transient elastography with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) at the same visit. RESULTS: LSM was not feasible by transient elastography (M/XL probe) in 18 (3.3%) and by 2D-SWE in 26 (4.7%) patients. The median LSM of transient elastography was 5.5 (2.8-75) kPa and of 2D-SWE 6.2 (3.7-46.2) kPa. LSMs by transient elastography and 2D-SWE were correlated regardless of the obesity status (r, 0.774; P < 0.001; r, 0.774; P < 0.001; r, 0.75; P < 0.001 in BMI <25, 25-30 and >/=30 kg/m2 respectively), or the degree of liver steatosis (r = 0.63; P < 0.001 and r = 0.743; P < 0.001 in mild and moderate/severe steatosis, respectively).

There is currently no approved therapy that specifically targets fibrosis. This study aims to assess the effect of endoscopic gastric plication on hepatic fibrosis in patients with underlying NAFLD. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected registry of patients with obesity and NAFLD with clinically significant hepatic fibrosis (>/=F2) who underwent endoscopic gastric plication. Full-thickness plications were placed in the gastric body using a commercially available platform to reduce the gastric volume. The primary outcome included various noninvasive tests (NITs) of hepatic fibrosis based on clinical chemistry and/or imaging. The secondary outcomes included NITs of hepatic steatosis, other metabolic outcomes, including hemoglobin A1c, insulin resistance, and total weight loss (TWL), and adverse events. RESULTS: Forty-five patients (age 51 +/- 13 years and body mass index 40.7 +/- 6.9 kg/m 2 ) were included. All patients underwent endoscopic gastric plication successfully. At 6-12 months, there were significant reductions in biochemistries (alanine aminotransferase: 49.7 +/- 36.8 U/L to 24.2 +/- 12.0 U/L [ P < 0.0001], aspartate aminotransferase: 39.1 +/- 24.1 U/L to 24.1 +/- 10.0 U/L [ P < 0.0001]), composite fibrosis score (NAFLD fibrosis score: 0.48 +/- 1.51 to -1.18 +/- 1.56 [ P < 0.0001], fibrosis-4 index: 1.4 +/- 1.2 to 1.2 +/- 0.7 [ P = 0.03]), and imaging-based markers of fibrosis (vibration-controlled transient elastography: 13.9 +/- 7.5 kPa to 8.9 +/- 4.8 kPa ( P < 0.0001) and Agile 3+: 0.53 +/- 0.28 to 0.37 +/- 0.28 [ P = 0.001]). There were significant reductions in controlled attenuation parameter, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, and hemoglobin A1c ( P < 0.05 for all).

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of COS against free fatty acid (FFA)-induced cellular hepatic steatosis and underlying mechanisms in HepG2 cells. Results showed that COS significantly reduced the lipid contents and elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes including total-superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase in FFA-stimulated HepG2 cells. COS phosphorylated the acetyl-CoA carboxylase and reduced both mRNA and protein levels of lipogenesis markers including fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c. COS also significantly increased the expression levels of fatty acid oxidation-related factors including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1, and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor alpha. Besides, COS markedly phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The inhibition of lipogenesis and the enhancement of fatty acid oxidation induced by COS were all blocked by AMPK antagonist (compound C), showing that the attenuation of hepatic steatosis by COS was dependent on AMPK activation. In conclusion, COS attenuated hepatic steatosis via suppressing lipid synthesis and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. AMPK was also involved in the alleviation of hepatic steatosis by COS. These results indicated that COS might be used as a potential ingredient to ameliorate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been regarded as pathological fat deposition in the liver, which includes a range of pathologies, from steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cellular carcinoma. Our findings demonstrated that Chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) attenuated steatosis via improving lipid metabolism. COS suppressed lipogenesis and also enhanced fatty acid oxidation.

Magnetic resonance elastography was performed using a 3.0-T scanner. After multislice segmentation of MRE images, 834 radiomic features were analyzed using a commercial program. Radiologic features, such as median and mean values of the regions of interest and variable clinical features, were analyzed.

A random forest classifier model was trained to use these features to classify the fibrosis stage. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was evaluated using a classifier for fibrosis stage diagnosis. RESULTS: The pathological hepatic fibrosis stage was classified as low-grade fibrosis (stages F0-F1, n = 82) or clinically significant fibrosis (stages F2-F4, n = 18). Eight important features were extracted from radiomics analysis, with the 2 most important being wavelet-high high low gray level dependence matrix dependence nonuniformity-normalized and wavelet-high high low gray level dependence matrix dependence entropy. The median value of the multiple small regions of interest was identified as the most important radiologic feature. Platelet count has been identified as an important clinical feature. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the classifier using radiomics was comparable with that of radiologic measures (0.97 +/- 0.07 and 0.96 +/- 0.06, respectively).

A tree-based classification categorised 2165 ingredients into three levels (food groups, sub-types, and cooking methods) and intakes were associated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: NAFLD patients had significantly higher consumption of refined rice, animal fat, red meat, refined sugar, and fried foods, and had lower consumption of vegetables, pulses, nuts, seeds, and milk compared to controls. The consumption of red meat, animal fat, nuts, and refined rice was positively associated with NAFLD diagnosis and the presence of fibrosis, whereas consumption of leafy vegetables, fruits, and dried pulses was negatively associated. Fried food consumption was positively associated with NAFLD, whilst boiled food consumption had a negative association. Increased consumption of animal fats was associated with diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular outcomes among those with NAFLD, whereas consumption of wholegrain rice was negatively associated with these clinical-related outcomes.

Albuminuria was defined as an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of >/=30 mg/g in random spot urine samples. NAFLD was defined as a fatty liver index (FLI) >/=60 or NAFLD liver fat score (LFS) > -0.64. RESULTS: A total of 289 (16.1 %) subjects were classified as having albuminuria. Subjects with NAFLD exhibited a higher rate of albuminuria than subjects without NAFLD (crude odds ratios [ORs] = 2.60-2.95, all P < 0.001). Regardless of hypertension, insulin resistance, or obesity, the risk for albuminuria was higher in the NAFLD group than in the group without NAFLD (measured by either FLI or LFS; all P < 0.001). When subjects with NAFLD had sarcopenia, the risk of albuminuria further increased (OR = 4.33-4.64, all P < 0.001).

Fatty liver index (FLI), an algorithm derived to screen NAFLD using the waist circumference, body mass index, triglyceride and gamma glutamyl-transferase concentration was rarely investigated in Asian paediatric population. Since each component is routinely measured in clinical practice, it is feasible to measure FLI even in resource limited settings. Hence, we determined the accuracy of FLI for the screening of NAFLD in obese children in Southern Sri Lanka. METHODS: A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted on ninety five children (56 boys) aged 5-15 years with BMI >/= 85th percentile for age and gender based on CDC 2000 growth charts recruited from the nutrition clinic at the Teaching Hospital, Karapitiya, Sri Lanka. NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography. Factors associated with ultrasonographic fatty liver such as biochemical parameters and fatty liver index in either sex or the whole population were determined by a multivariate analysis. The ability of FLI to screen NAFLD was determined by the analysis of area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) and the maximum Youden index analysis. RESULTS: Overweight and obese children with ultrasonographic fatty liver had a significantly higher FLI than those without fatty liver according to the multivariate analysis performed (Odds ratio 3.524; 95% CI 1.104-11.256, P = 0.033). AUROC of FLI for NAFLD was 0.692 (95% CI; 0.565-0.786) and the optimal cut off value for the screening of NAFLD was 30 (Maximum Youden index 0.2782, Sensitivity, 58.33%; Specificity, 69.49%).

The prevalence of NAFLD in children is increasing, suggesting a role for the developmental environment in programming susceptibility. However, the role of developmental Cd exposure in programming NAFLD and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We have proposed that imprinted genes are strong candidates for connecting the early life environment and later life disease. In support of this, we previously identified roles for the Imprinted Gene Network (IGN) and its regulator Zac1 in programming NAFLD in response to maternal metabolic dysfunction. Here, we test the hypothesis that developmental Cd exposure is sufficient to program NAFLD, and further, that this process is mediated by Zac1 and the IGN. Using mice, we show that developmental cadmium chloride (CdCl2) exposure leads to histological, biochemical, and molecular signatures of steatosis and fibrosis in juveniles. Transcriptomic analyses comparing livers of CdCl2-exposed and control mice show upregulation of Zac1 and the IGN coincident with disease presentation. Increased hepatic Zac1 expression is independent of promoter methylation and imprinting statuses. Finally, we show that over-expression of Zac1 in cultured hepatocytes is sufficient to induce lipid accumulation in a Ppargamma-dependent manner and demonstrate direct binding of Zac1 to the Ppargamma promoter. Our findings demonstrate that developmental Cd exposure is sufficient to program NAFLD in later life, and with our previous work, establish Zac1 and the IGN as key regulators of prosteatotic and profibrotic pathways, two of the major pathological hallmarks of NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36200916/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/6749604 https://sci-hub.do/kfac106 https://sci-hub.do/10.1093/toxsci/kfac106", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "pl": "United States"}, {"uid": 35490415, "aid": "WestAfrJMed.2022April;39(4):407-414", "titl": "Clinical Correlates of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis in Nigerian Patients with Metabolic Syndrome.", "mesh": "Cross-Sectional Studies;;; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology;;; *Dyslipidemias/complications;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Male;;; *Metabolic Syndrome/epidemiology;;; Middle Aged;;; Nigeria/epidemiology;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology;;; Obesity/complications", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Obasi, E; Adekanle, E; Ajayi, N A; Ndububa, D A", "jour": "West African journal of medicine", "affl": "Department of Medicine, Gastroenterology Unit, Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria.;;; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Clinical Sciences, Obafemi Awolowo University/Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile Ife, Osun State, Nigeria.;;; Department of Medicine, Gastroenterology Unit, Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria.;;; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Clinical Sciences, Obafemi Awolowo University/Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile Ife, Osun State, Nigeria.", "pdat": "2022 Apr 29", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Control group comprised subjects without liver diseases. Age, gender, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 25OHD levels, and the date of the measurements were recorded. RESULTS: We compared ALT and 25OHD measurements between the patient and control groups, and between the simple steatosis and NASH subgroups. 25OHD levels were lower and ALT levels were higher in the patient group (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.028, and p < 0.001, effect size = 0.442, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that when 25OHD levels decrease by 1 ng/dL, it increases the risk of being in the patient group by 3.7%.

Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate the beneficial effects of PPARgamma agonists on NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Understanding PPARgamma regulators may therefore aid in unraveling the mechanisms governing the development and progression of NAFLD. Recent advances in high-throughput biology and genome sequencing have greatly facilitated the identification of epigenetic modifiers, including DNA methylation, histone modifiers, and non-coding RNAs as key factors that regulate PPARgamma in NAFLD. In contrast, little is still known about the particular molecular mechanisms underlying the intricate relationships between these events.

It is well established that aging induces pathological changes in liver and potentiates the occurrence and progression of NAFLD, HCC and other age-related liver diseases. Studies of senescent cells also indicate a pivotal engagement in the development of NAFLD via diverse mechanisms.

The treatment with Zingerone attenuated the gain in final body weights, preserved liver structure, and downregulated the transcription of Bax and cleaved caspase-3. In the HFD and STD-fed rats, Zingerone reduced levels of fasting glucose and insulin and circulatory levels of cholesterol (CHOL) and triglycerides (TGs). Concomitantly, Zingerone enhanced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, depleted levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and enhanced the nuclear levels of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). In addition, it lowered the levels of inflammatory cytokines and the nuclear levels of the nuclear factor kappa beta p65 (NF-kappaB p65). All these biochemical changes were associated with an increment in the phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK) (activation) and reduced mRNA levels of SREBP1 and SREBP2.

High FIB-4 in viral hepatitis, NAFLD, and ALD was associated with significantly high hepatocellular carcinoma incidence and mortality. Additionally, FIB-4 showed the ability to predict high-risk varices with cut-offs of 2.87 and 3.91 in cirrhosis patients and predict long-term survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after hepatectomy. In acute liver injury caused by COVID-19, FIB-4 had a predictive value for mechanical ventilation and 30-day mortality.

Current therapeutic recommendations focus on lifestyle changes in order to reduce the incidence of risk factors and drugs targeting major molecular pathways potentially involved in the development of this disease. Given that a pharmacological treatment, completely safe and effective, is not currently known in recent years more research has been done on the effects that some bio-active natural compounds, derived from plants, have in preventing the onset and progression of NAFLD. Numerous studies, in animals and humans, have shown that phytosterols (PSs) play an important role in this pathology. Phytosterols are natural products that are found naturally in plant. More than 250 phytosterols have been identified, but the most common in the diet are stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, and campesterol. Consumption of dietary PSs can reduce serum cholesterol levels. Due to these properties, most studies have focused on their action on lipid metabolism and the evolution of NAFLD.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD when complicated by other liver diseases has not been established completely. Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) involves more metabolic factors than NAFLD, regardless of complications with other diseases. This study aimed to clarify the effects of fatty liver occurring with metabolic disorders, such as MAFLD without diabetes mellitus (DM), on the development of DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 9,459 participants who underwent two or more annual health check-ups. The participants were divided into the MAFLD group (fatty liver disease with overweight/obesity or non-overweight/obesity complicated by metabolic disorders), simple fatty liver group (fatty liver disease other than MAFLD group), metabolic disorder group (metabolic disorder without fatty liver disease), and normal group (all other participants). RESULTS: The DM onset rates in the normal, simple fatty liver, metabolic disorder, and MAFLD groups were 0.51, 1.85, 2.52, and 7.36%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the MAFLD group showed a significantly higher risk of DM onset compared with other three groups (P < 0.01). Additionally, the risk of DM onset was significantly increased in fatty liver disease with overweight/obesity or pre-diabetes (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Fatty liver with metabolic disorders, such as MAFLD, can be used to identify patients with fatty liver disease who are at high risk of developing DM.

Recently, several experimental in vivo animal models for NAFLD/NASH have been established. However, no reproducible experimental animal model displays the full spectrum of pathophysiological, histological, molecular, and clinical features associated with human NAFLD/NASH progression. Although methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet and high-fat diet (HFD) models can mimic histological and metabolic abnormalities of human disease, respectively, the molecular signaling pathways are extremely important for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. This review aimed to assess the differences in gene expression patterns and NAFLD/NASH progression pathways among the most common dietary animal models, i.e., HFD- and MCD diet-fed animals. Studies showed that the HFD and MCD diet could induce either up- or downregulation of the expression of genes and proteins that are involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrogenesis pathways. Interestingly, the MCD diet model could spontaneously develop liver fibrosis within two to four weeks and has significant effects on the expression of genes that encode proteins and enzymes involved in the liver fibrogenesis pathway.

However, different effects of pioglitazone on NAFLD have been demonstrated in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Herein, a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials was carried out to indirectly compare pioglitazone in NAFLD patients with vs. without type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pioglitazone vs. placebo involving NAFLD patients with or without type 2 diabetes/prediabetes collected from databases were enrolled into this analysis. Methodological quality was employed to evaluate the domains recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The analysis covered the changes in histology (fibrosis, hepatocellular ballooning, inflammation, steatosis), liver enzymes, blood lipids, fasting blood glucose (FBS), homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR), weight and body mass index (BMI) before and after treatment, and adverse events. RESULTS: The review covered seven articles, with 614 patients in total, of which three were non-diabetic RCTs. No difference was found in patients with vs. without type 2 diabetes in histology, liver enzymes, blood lipids, HOMA-IR, weight, BMI, and FBS. Moreover, no significant difference was revealed in adverse effects between NAFLD patients with diabetes and without DM, except the incidence of edema that was found to be higher in the pioglitazone group than in the placebo group in NAFLD patients with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Pioglitazone could exert a certain effect on alleviating NAFLD, which was consistent between non-diabetic NAFLD patients and diabetic NAFLD patients in improving histopathology, liver enzymes, and HOMA-IR and reducing blood lipids. Furthermore, there were no adverse effects, except the incidence of edema which is higher in the pioglitazone group in NAFLD patients with diabetes.

The elevation of C16:0, C18:0 and C18:1 fatty acids in the liver that were observed in the HFD-60 group was recovered by the HSA-FGF21 administration. The increased expression levels of the hepatic fatty acid uptake receptor (CD36) and fatty acid synthase (SREBP-1c, FAS, SCD-1, Elovl6) were also suppressed. In adipose tissue, HSA-FGF21 caused an improved adipocyte hypertrophy, a decrease in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and induced the expression of adiponectin and thermogenic factors.

METHODS: We performed a 2-sample bidirectional MR analysis using summary-level data from genome-wide association studies of SUA (with up to 110 347 individuals) and NAFLD (1483 cases and 17781 controls) in European populations. First, 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SUA were selected as instruments to estimate the causal effect of elevated SUA levels on the risk of NAFLD using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. Then we performed MR with 3 SNPs as genetic instruments for NAFLD. To test the reliability, further sensitivity analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: Our MR analyses demonstrated that NAFLD was associated with SUA levels (beta = 0.032, P = 0.003). Similar results were obtained using other MR methods and in sensitivity analyses. Genetic predisposition to elevated SUA levels was not associated with NAFLD (IVW MR, odds ratio = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.90-1.15, P = 0.775). Similar results were obtained using other 4 pleiotropy robust MR methods and in sensitivity analyses, excluding 9 SNPs associated with potential confounders.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2021. 644 T2DM cases from 13 communities in Heping District, Shenyang City were selected. All the surveyed subjects underwent physical examination (measurements of height, body mass index, neck circumference, waist circumference, abdominal circumference, hip circumference, and blood pressure), infection screening (excluding hepatitis B and C, AIDS, and syphilis), random fingertip blood glucose, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and liver stiffness measurement (LSM). The study subjects were divided into the non-advanced chronic liver disease group and the advanced chronic liver disease group according to whether the LSM value was greater than 10 kPa. Cirrhotic portal hypertension development was indicated in patients with LSM >/= 15 kPa. The comparison of multiple mean values among the sample groups was performed by analysis of variance when the normal distribution was met. Results: In the T2DM community population, there were 401 cases (62.27%) combined with NAFLD, 63 cases (9.78%) combined with advanced chronic liver disease, and 14 cases (2.17%) combined with portal hypertension.

However, the correlation between NAFLD and depression has not been well illustrated. METHODS: Studies that investigate the association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and depression were searched in multiple electronic databases. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) of the included articles were calculated using a fixed- or random effects model. RESULTS: A total of seven articles were included in this study. The results of the meta-analysis showed that compared with those without nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, individuals with it had a significantly increased risk of depression (pooled OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.24, p = 0.007), and there was evidence that heterogeneity was not significant (I(2) = 13.6%, p for heterogeneity = 0.324). Moreover, depressed patients had a significantly increased risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease compared with non-depressed patients (pooled OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.85, p = 0.002), and evidence of non-significant heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 0%, p = 0.837 for heterogeneity).

In this review, we address the state of research on genetics and epigenetics of NAFLD with focus on key discoveries and conceptual advances over the past 2 years. RECENT FINDINGS: The analysis of NAFLD-associated genetic variant effects on the whole-transcriptome, including quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with gene expression (eQTL) or splicing (sQTL) may explain pleiotropic effects. Functional experiments on NAFLD-epigenetics, including profiling of liver chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTL) show co-localization with numerous genome-wide association study signals linked to metabolic and cardiovascular traits. Novel studies provide insights into the modulation of the hepatic transcriptome and epigenome by tissue microbiotas. Genetic variation of components of the liver cellular respirasome may result in broad cellular and metabolic effects. Mitochondrial noncoding RNAs may regulate liver inflammation and fibrogenesis. RNA modifications as N6-methyladenosine may explain sex-specific differences in liver gene transcription linked to lipid traits. SUMMARY: The latest developments in the field of NAFLD-genomics can be leveraged for identifying novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets that may prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with disease progression.

Our objective was to develop and validate two new scores (Agile 4 and Agile 3+) to identify cirrhosis or AF, respectively, with optimized positive predictive value and fewer indeterminate results, in individuals with NAFLD attending liver clinics. METHODS: This international study included seven adult cohorts with suspected NAFLD who underwent liver biopsy, LSM and blood sampling during routine clinical practice or screening for trials. The population was randomly divided into a training set and an internal validation set, on which the best-fitting logistic regression model was built, and performance and goodness of fit were assessed, respectively. Furthermore, both scores were externally validated on two large cohorts. Cut-offs for high sensitivity and specificity were derived in the training set to rule-out and rule-in cirrhosis or AF and then tested in the validation set and compared to FIB-4 and LSM. RESULTS: Each score combined LSM, AST/ALT ratio, platelets, sex and diabetes status, as well as age for Agile 3+. Calibration plots for Agile 4 and Agile 3+ indicated satisfactory to excellent goodness of fit. Agile 4 and Agile 3+ outperformed FIB-4 and LSM in terms of AUROC, percentage of patients with indeterminate results and positive predictive value to rule-in cirrhosis or AF. CONCLUSIONS: The two novel non-invasive scores improve identification of cirrhosis or AF among individuals with NAFLD attending liver clinics and reduce the need for liver biopsy in this population. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Non-invasive tests currently used to identify patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, such as fibrosis-4 index and liver stiffness measurement by vibration-controlled transient elastography, have high negative predictive values but high false positive rates, while results are indeterminate for a large number of cases. This study provides scores that will help the clinician diagnose advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. These new easy-to-implement scores will help liver specialists to better identify (1) patients who need more intensive follow-up, (2) patients who should be referred for inclusion in therapeutic trials, and (3) which patients should be treated with pharmacological agents when effective therapies are approved.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36375686/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0168-8278(22)03293-7 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jhep.2022.10.034", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Netherlands"}, {"uid": 34562443, "aid": "S0022-3476(21)00909-4 10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.09.033", "titl": "The Prevalence of Elevated Alanine Aminotransferase Levels Meeting Clinical Action Thresholds in Children with Obesity in Primary Care Practice.", "mesh": "Adolescent;;; Alanine Transaminase/*blood;;; Biomarkers/blood;;; Child;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Male;;; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology;;; Obesity/blood/*epidemiology;;; Prevalence", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Wu, Stephanie J; Darbinian, Jeanne A; Schwimmer, Jeffrey B; Yu, Elizabeth L; Ramalingam, Nirmala D; Greenspan, Louise C; Lo, Joan C", "jour": "The Journal of pediatrics", "affl": "Department of Medicine, Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, Oakland, CA.;;; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA.;;; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA; Department of Gastroenterology, Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA.;;; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA; Department of Gastroenterology, Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA.;;; Department of Medicine, Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, Oakland, CA.;;; Kaiser Permanente San Francisco Medical Center, San Francisco, CA; The Permanente Medical Group, Oakland, CA.;;; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA; The Permanente Medical Group, Oakland, CA.", "pdat": "2022 Jan", "tiab": "Using a clinically actionable threshold for alanine aminotransferase to define suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in US children with obesity, the risk of suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was highest for Asian and Hispanic race/ethnicity, male sex, and severe obesity.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34562443/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0022-3476(21)00909-4 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.09.033", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "United States"}, {"uid": 36082882, "aid": "10.5005/japi-11001-0097", "titl": "Assessment of Visceral Fat Volume and Its Correlation with the Severity of Hepatic Fibrosis in Patients with NAFLD.", "mesh": "Biopsy;;; *Elasticity Imaging Techniques/methods;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Intra-Abdominal Fat/diagnostic imaging;;; Liver/diagnostic imaging;;; Liver Cirrhosis/complications;;; Male;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Varghese, Jijo; Devadas, Krishnadas; Joseph, Rathan Cyriac; Oommen, Tharun Tom; Hareendran, Atul; Nahaz, Nibin; Narayanan, Vijay; George, Bony", "jour": "The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India", "affl": "Senior Resident; Corresponding Author.;;; Professor and Head of the Department.;;; Senior Resident.;;; Senior Resident.;;; Medical College Thiruvananthapuram.;;; Senior Resident, Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Medical College Thiruvananthapuram, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.", "pdat": "2022 Sep", "tiab": "INTRODUCTION: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease.

Early reports demonstrated direct effect of novel coronavirus on the liver, but subsequently, this did not stand up to validation. The SARS-CoV-2 virus affects the liver differentially; in healthy compared to those with preexisting liver disease. AREAS COVERED: This exhaustive paper reviews the current, literature on mechanisms by which COVID-19 affects the healthy liver and those with preexisting liver disease such as alcohol-related and nonalcoholic fatty liver, autoimmune liver disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, viral hepatitis, and liver transplant recipients, with special mention on drug-and herb-induced liver injury with COVID-19 therapies. Search methodology: the review (Dec. 2022 - Jan. 2023) is based on PubMed (NLM) search using the keyword 'COVID' with supplementary searches using 'fibrosis;' 'liver;' 'cirrhosis;' 'CLD;' 'NAFLD;' 'NASH;' 'hepatocellular carcinoma;' 'hepatitis;' 'fatty liver;' 'alcohol;' 'viral;' 'transplant;' and 'liver failure.'

Although metabolic syndrome is commonly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), there exist no information on afamin and NAFLD. METHODS: Afamin concentrations were cross-sectionally measured in 146 Austrian patients with NAFLD, in 45 patients without NAFLD, and in 292 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, the feasibility of afamin to predict incident NAFLD was evaluated in 1,434 adult participants in the population-based Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study during a 10-year follow-up. RESULTS: Median afamin concentrations were significantly higher in NAFLD patients (83.6 mg/L) than in patients without NAFLD (61.6 mg/L, p<0.0001) or in healthy controls (63.9 mg/L, p<0.0001). In age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression analyses a 10 mg/L increase of afamin was associated with a 1.5-fold increase of having NAFLD as compared with patients without NAFLD and the risk was even two-fold when compared with healthy controls. In the population-based cohort, afamin concentrations at baseline were significantly lower in participants without NAFLD (n=1,195) than in 239 participants who developed NAFLD (56.5 vs. 66.9 mg/L, p<0.0001) during the 10-year follow up, with highest afamin values observed in individuals developing severe forms of NAFLD. After adjustment for several potentially confounding parameters, afamin remained an independent predictor for the development of NAFLD (OR=1.37 [95% CI 1.23-1.54] per 10 mg/L increase, p<0.0001).

This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effect of PD against NAFLD in vitro. AML-12 cells were pretreated with 300 microM palmitic acid (PA) for 24 h to model NAFLD in vitro. Then, the cells were either treated with PD or received no PD treatment for 24 h. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed using 2',7'-dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining, and the mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by the JC-1 staining method. Moreover, the protein expression levels of LC3-II/LC3-I and p62/SQSTM1 in the cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting. PD was found to significantly decrease the ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential levels in the PA-treated group compared to the control group. Meanwhile, PD increased the LC3-II/LC3-I levels and decreased the p62/SQSTM1 levels in the PA-treated group compared to the control group.

In 2020, a group of international experts proposed the change of name to metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with the main objective of making it an inclusive diagnosis prioritizing metabolic abnormalities. However, the change in terminology included the modification of the diagnostic criteria allowing the non-exclusion of other concomitant liver diseases such as alcohol liver disease, and chronic hepatitis B or C.

But it also precipitated a wave of epidemiological and clinical studies which, two years later, have provided clinical evidence on the differences and similarities of the two entities, specially, those that could be considered for future refinements of the diagnostic criteria of MAFLD. Likewise, this evidence may contribute to deciding the time of adoption of this terminology.

A non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics analysis was used to identify metabolic changes associated with NAFLD in humans upon exercise intervention (without diet change) across four different sample types-adipose tissue (AT), plasma, urine, and stool. Altogether, 46 subjects with NAFLD participated in this randomized controlled intervention study. The intervention group (n = 21) performed high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for 12 weeks while the control group (n = 25) kept their sedentary lifestyle. The participants' clinical parameters and metabolic profiles were compared between baseline and endpoint. HIIT significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose concentration (p = 0.027) and waist circumference (p = 0.028); and increased maximum oxygen consumption rate and maximum achieved workload (p < 0.001). HIIT resulted in sample-type-specific metabolite changes, including accumulation of amino acids and their derivatives in AT and plasma, while decreasing in urine and stool. Moreover, many of the metabolite level changes especially in the AT were correlated with the clinical parameters monitored during the intervention. In addition, certain lipids increased in plasma and decreased in the stool. Glyco-conjugated bile acids decreased in AT and urine. The 12-week HIIT exercise intervention has beneficial ameliorating effects in NAFLD subjects on a whole-body level, even without dietary changes and weight loss. The metabolomics analysis applied to the four different sample matrices provided an overall view on several metabolic pathways that had tissue-type specific changes after HIIT intervention in subjects with NAFLD. The results highlight especially the role of AT in responding to the HIIT challenge, and suggest that altered amino acid metabolism in AT might play a critical role in e.g. improving fasting plasma glucose concentration.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03995056).", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35444259/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41598-022-10481-9 https://sci-hub.do/10481 https://sci-hub.do/10.1038/s41598-022-10481-9", "pt": "Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 35605744, "aid": "S0168-8278(22)00316-6 10.1016/j.jhep.2022.04.040", "titl": "Ethyl glucuronide in hair detects a high rate of harmful alcohol consumption in presumed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.", "mesh": "Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects;;; *Alcoholism/complications/diagnosis/metabolism;;; Biomarkers/metabolism;;; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism;;; Ethanol/metabolism;;; Glucuronates/metabolism;;; Hair/metabolism;;; Humans;;; *Liver Diseases, Alcoholic/metabolism;;; Male;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology;;; Retrospective Studies;;; gamma-Glutamyltransferase", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Staufer, Katharina; Huber-Schonauer, Ursula; Strebinger, Georg; Pimingstorfer, Philipp; Suesse, Silke; Scherzer, Thomas-Matthias; Paulweber, Bernhard; Ferenci, Peter; Stimpfl, Thomas; Yegles, Michel; Datz, Christian; Trauner, Michael", "jour": "Journal of hepatology", "affl": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Department of General Surgery, Division of Transplantation, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

We investigated alcohol consumption in patients with presumed NAFLD and ALD using novel objective alcohol markers. METHODS: In total, 184 consecutive patients were included in this prospective observational study. Alcohol intake was assessed by ethylglucuronide in hair (hEtG) and urine (uEtG); the utility of these measures for alcohol detection was compared to Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C), carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and ALD/NAFLD index (ANI). Clinical characteristics of patients with NAFLD and ALD were re-assessed after reclassification based on repeated moderate (>/=10 g <60 g EtOH/day) and excessive (>/=60 g EtOH/day) alcohol consumption, and patients were retrospectively reclassified based on MAFLD criteria. RESULTS: Repeated moderate to excessive alcohol consumption was detected in 28.6%, 28.5%, and 25.0% of patients with presumed NAFLD, ALD or MAFLD, respectively. ANI score, AUDIT-C, uEtG, and hEtG showed AUCs of 0.628, 0.733, 0.754, and 0.927 for the detection of repeated moderate to excessive alcohol consumption, respectively. The indirect markers CDT, MCV and GGT were not reliable. Patients with repeated moderate or excessive alcohol consumption were significantly more often male, had a significantly lower BMI, and suffered significantly less often from type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: In total, 28.6% of patients with presumed NAFLD, and 25.0% with MAFLD are at risk of alcohol-related liver damage. AUDIT-C, uEtG and hEtG should be used to screen for alcohol consumption in patients with fatty liver disease. LAY SUMMARY: Fatty liver disease can be caused by metabolic factors and/or alcohol consumption. The diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is based on the exclusion of harmful alcohol consumption, while metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), which has been proposed as a new name for NAFLD, is based on the presence of metabolic comorbidities and allows for alcohol consumption. Herein, we show that up to 29% of patients diagnosed with NAFLD and 25% with MAFLD are at risk of alcohol-related liver damage. We show that ethyl glucuronide (a metabolite of alcohol) in the hair and urine can accurately detect potentially harmful alcohol consumption in these patients - as such, these tests should be integrated into routine diagnostic work-up for patients with fatty liver disease.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35605744/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0168-8278(22)00316-6 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jhep.2022.04.040", "pt": "Journal Article; Observational Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Netherlands"}, {"uid": 35645140, "aid": "345819 SJG-28-426 10.4103/sjg.sjg_73_22", "titl": "Transient elastography for the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: Evidence from the CORDIAL cohort study.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology;;; *Elasticity Imaging Techniques/methods;;; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/epidemiology;;; Cohort Studies;;; Prevalence;;; Liver Cirrhosis/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/complications;;; Liver/pathology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Alfadda, Assim A; Sherbeeni, Suphia M; Alqutub, Adel N; Aldosary, Abdullah S; Aldaghri, Nasser M; Taylor-Robinson, Simon D; Alqahtani, Saleh A; Gul, Rukhsana; Almaghamsi, Abdulrahman M", "jour": "Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association", "affl": "Obesity Research Center; Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.;;; Tadaw Medical Complex and Day Surgery Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of Medical Imaging Administration, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.;;; Chair for Biomarkers of Chronic Diseases, Biochemistry Department, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of Surgery and Cancer, St. Mary's Hospital Campus, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.;;; Liver Transplant Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.;;; Obesity Research Center, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.;;; Obesity, Endocrine and Metabolism Center, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.", "pdat": "2022 Nov-Dec", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

METHODS: A total of 490 patients with T2DM who attended diabetes and primary care clinics were recruited. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurements (LSM) were obtained via FibroScan to assess steatosis and fibrosis. RESULTS: Of the examined 490 patients with T2DM, 396 (80.8%) had hepatic steatosis (CAP >/=248 dB/m): 326 (66.5%) had severe steatosis (CAP >/=280 dB/m), while 41 (8.4%) and 29 (5.9%) had mild (CAP >/=248 to <268 dB/m) and moderate steatosis (CAP >/=268 to <280 dB/m), respectively. Of the 396 patients with steatosis, only 35 (8.8%) had LSM >/=7.9 kPa, suggesting the presence of fibrosis, while 361 (91%) had LSM <7.9 kPa, indicating the absence of fibrosis. Increased body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were positively associated with both steatosis and fibrosis. After adjusting for age and gender, data from logistic regression analysis demonstrated BMI, waist circumference, SBP, ALT, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) as significant independent factors for steatosis, while SBP was the only significant predictor associated with fibrosis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the associations between NAFLD and both plasma thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at the phenotypic and genetic levels. METHODS: We included 14 797 participants, aged 20 to 74 years who had undergone abdominal ultrasonography during the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine the observational associations of TSH and T4 with NAFLD. Mediation analyses were performed to study whether the relationship between NAFLD and TSH levels was mediated via potential confounders. A bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to determine the potential causal relationship. RESULTS: Multivariable logistic regression model suggested a \"dose-response\" relationship between TSH (Q4 vs Q1: OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.52; Ptrend = 0.001) and NAFLD. BMI and ALT partially mediated the association between TSH and NAFLD, while the proportion of the mediation effects of BMI and ALT were 39.1% and 22.3%, respectively.

Objective: to evaluate the prevalence of NAFLD in a cohort of patients with T2D. Methods: an observational, descriptive study performed between May 2018 and December 2019 at the Endocrinology and Nutrition Unit. The chi(2) test was performed for qualitative variables and a non-parametric test for the comparison of medians of quantitative variables. Steatosis degree was defined by the coefficient attenuated parameter (CAP): (S0: < 248 dB/m; S1: 248-268 dB/m; S2: 268-288 dB/m; S3: > 288 dB/m) or stiffness: F0-F1: < 8 kPa; F2: 8-10 kPa; F3: 10-15 kPa; F4: > 15 kPa, using transient elastography (TE) (FibroScan(R)). A univariate analysis was performed and subsequently a multivariate analysis with statistically significant variables used to study the predictive factors of intense steatosis and advanced fibrosis. Results: n = 104 patients with T2D; 84 (80.7 %) were obese. TE demonstrated advanced fibrosis in 20 % and intense steatosis (S3) in more than 50 %. Lower total bilirubin (OR: 0.028; 95 % CI: (0.002-0.337); p = 0.005) was found to be an independent factor for S3 steatosis in the multivariate analysis. BMI ((OR: 1.497; 95 % CI: (1.102-2.034); p = 0.01)) was a predictive factor for advanced fibrosis in a multivariate analysis.

The hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is enhanced greatly to contribute to steatosis in NAFLD. The spliced form of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s) initiates DNL independently of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). AIM OF THE STUDY: To disclose the mechanism of inhibition on hepatic DNL by QHD and the responsible compounds. METHODS: The effects of QHD on hepatic DNL were evaluated in mice induced by high-fructose diet (HFru). The effects of the serum-absorbed compounds of QHD on XBP1s were evaluated in HepG2 cells induced by tunicamycin. Hepatic histology, triglyceride (TG) and nonesterified fatty acids were observed. Hepatic apolipoprotein B100 and very low-density lipoprotein were measured to reflect lipid out-transport. The mRNA expression of XBP1s and its target genes were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression of TG synthetases and DNL enzymes, and inositol requirement enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1alpha), phosphorylated IRE1alpha and XBP1s were detected in liver tissue and HepG2 cells by western-blot. The binding activity of SREBP1, protein expression of ChREBP and XBP1s were detected in the nuclear extracts of liver tissue. RESULTS: Dynamical observing suggested feeding with HFru for 2 weeks was sufficient to induce hepatic lipogenesis and XBP1s. QHD ameliorated liver steatosis without enhancing out-transport of lipids, accompanied with more inhibitory effects on DNL enzymes than TG synthetases. QHD inhibits the nuclear XBP1s without affecting ChREBP and SREBP1. In QHD, chlorogenic acid, geniposide and polydatin inhibit lipogenesis initiated by XPB1s. CONCLUSION: QHD probably decreases hepatic DNL by inhibiting XBP1s independent of SREBP1 and ChREBP.

The diagnostic performance of the NCS was similar in the STELLAR studies (AUC 0.700; 95%CI 0.680-0.730) and a smaller cohort from China (AUC 0.727; 95%CI 0.533-0.921). In the European NAFLD Registry, spanning all histological fibrosis stages, the NCS exhibited an AUC of 0.798 (95%CI 0.766-0.830) to detect cirrhosis. We derived two NCS cut-off values (<64.5 and >79.17) to classify patients at low, intermediate, or high risk for the presence of cirrhosis. Using these cut-offs, further diagnostic workup could be avoided by ruling in or ruling out cirrhosis in approximately half of the patients. Furthermore, NCS identified patients at risk for progression to cirrhosis in the F3 cohort and liver-related outcomes in the F4 cohort. CONCLUSION: The NCS is a simple tool to improve the identification of compensated cirrhosis within the large group of advanced disease stage and provides prognostic information.

We aimed to investigate the differences in prescription trends of antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering drugs among adult patients according to the presence of comorbid NAFLD and/or NASH. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using a large claims database from January 2013 to December 2020. RESULTS: Among 7,716,908 people, 47,157 patients with T2D, 180,050 with hypertension, and 191,348 with dyslipidemia were identified. A total of 8,897, 16,451, and 24,762 patients with NAFLD, as well as 435, 523, and 1033 patients with NASH, had T2D, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, respectively. Among antidiabetic drugs, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and thiazolidine were more frequently prescribed to patients with NAFLD than to those without NAFLD (non-NAFLD) (thiazolidine: 1.4% and 2.8% and SGLT2is: 17.8% and 25.9% for non-NAFLD and NAFLD, respectively [2019-2020]). Among antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists exhibited a slightly higher prescription ratio in patients with NAFLD (33.6% vs. 39.0%). Regarding lipid-lowering drugs, fibrates were more frequently prescribed to patients with NAFLD (10.3% vs. 18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Specific drugs tended to be prescribed to patients with NAFLD.

In this study, the liver-protective effect of RTE on mice with high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD was investigated for the first time, and the underlying molecular mechanism was explored via integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics. The results showed that RTE mitigated liver damage, which was evidenced by declined inflammatory cell infiltration in liver, decreased liver function markers, oxidative stress indexes, lipid profile levels and inflammatory cytokines levels. The differential metabolites by metabonomics illustrated supplementation of RTE affected metabolomics pathways including tryptophan metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, which are all involved in oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, the five differential expression genes (DEGs) through liver transcriptomics were screened and recognized, namely Tnfrsf21, Ifit1, Inhbb, Mapk15 and Gadd45g, which revealed that HFD induced Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, NF-kappaB signaling pathway NOD-like receptor pathway, TNF signaling pathway. Integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics confirmed the supplementation of RTE had significantly regulatory effects on the metabolic pathways involved in inflammatory responses. Additionally, RT-PCR and western blot authenticated RTE intervention regulated the mRNA levels of liver genes involved in inflammation response and inhibited the liver endotoxin-TLR4-NF-kappaB pathway triggered by HFD, thus alleviating NAFLD.

While almost 1 in 4 adults now use at least 3 concurrent prescription drugs in the United States, the Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence has also risen over 25%. The effect of NALFD on DDIs is largely unknown. NAFLD is characterized by lipid vesicle accumulation in the liver, which can progress to severe steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatic carcinoma. The CYP450 enzyme family dysregulation in NAFLD, which might already alter the efficacy and toxicity of drugs, has been partially characterized. Nevertheless, the drug-induced dysregulation of CYP450 enzymes has not been studied in the fatty liver. These changes in enzymatic inducibility during NAFLD, when taking concurrent drugs, could cause unexpected fatalities through inadvertent DDIs. We have, thus, developed an in vitro model to investigate the CYP450 transcriptional regulation in NAFLD. Specifically, we cultured primary human hepatocytes in a medium containing free fatty acids, high glucose, and insulin for seven days. These cultures displayed intracellular macro-steatosis after 5 days and cytokine secretion resembling NAFLD patients. We further verified the model's dysregulation in the transcription of key CYP450 enzymes. We then exposed the NAFLD model to the drug inducers rifampicin, Omeprazole, and Phenytoin as activators of transcription factors pregnane X receptor (PXR), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), respectively. In the NAFLD model, Omeprazole maintained an expected induction of CYP1A1, however Phenytoin and Rifampicin showed elevated induction of CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 compared to healthy cultures. We, thus, conclude that the fatty liver could cause aggravated drug-drug interactions in NAFLD or NASH patients related to CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 enzymes.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35062050/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0753-3322(21)01161-6 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112377", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "France"}, {"uid": 35429164, "aid": "CPT2614 10.1002/cpt.2614", "titl": "Considerations for Physiologically Based Modeling in Liver Disease: From Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver (NAFL) to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH).", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/drug therapy/metabolism;;; Liver Cirrhosis;;; *Metabolic Syndrome;;; Comorbidity;;; Disease Progression;;; Liver/metabolism", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Murphy, William A; Adiwidjaja, Jeffry; Sjostedt, Noora; Yang, Kyunghee; Beaudoin, James J; Spires, Jessica; Siler, Scott Q; Neuhoff, Sibylle; Brouwer, Kim L R", "jour": "Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics", "affl": "Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.;;; Simulations Plus, Inc., Lancaster, California, USA.;;; Division of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;;; DILIsym Services Division, Simulations Plus Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.;;; DILIsym Services Division, Simulations Plus Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.;;; Simulations Plus, Inc., Lancaster, California, USA.;;; DILIsym Services Division, Simulations Plus Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.;;; Certara UK Ltd.

Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of NAFLD-mediated changes in drug disposition and efficacy/toxicity. Despite extensive clinical pharmacokinetic data in cirrhosis, current knowledge concerning pharmacokinetic alterations in NAFLD, particularly at different stages of disease progression, is relatively limited. In vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation coupled with physiologically based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (IVIVE-PBPK/PD) modeling offers a promising approach for optimizing pharmacologic predictions while refining and reducing clinical studies in this population. Use of IVIVE-PBPK to predict intra-organ drug concentrations at pharmacologically relevant sites of action is particularly advantageous when it can be linked to pharmacodynamic effects. Quantitative systems pharmacology/toxicology (QSP/QST) modeling can be used to translate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from PBPK/PD models into clinically relevant predictions of drug response and toxicity. In this review, a detailed summary of NAFLD-mediated alterations in human physiology relevant to drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) is provided. The application of literature-derived physiologic parameters and ADME-associated protein abundance data to inform virtual NAFLD population development and facilitate PBPK/PD, QSP, and QST predictions is discussed along with current limitations of these methodologies and knowledge gaps.

Methods: One hundred and nineteen patients (male/female, 66/53; mean age 54.54 +/- 12.90 years) underwent abdominal non-contrast-enhanced CT. CT images were examined to determine the attenuation of liver parenchyma, subcutaneous fat depth, and waist circumference (WC).

We successfully synthesized a novel recombinant bifunctional fusion protein with high stability and low immunogenicity.

METHODS: In this study, five nonalcoholic fatty liver patients were included in the disease group, and five simple obesity patients were included in the control group. Exosomes from NAFLD patient serum were collected, and exosomal miRNAs were extracted. Exosomes were isolated and then confirmed by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western blotting. High-throughput sequencing methods were used to determine the expression profile of exosome-derived miRNAs. RESULTS: The sequencing results revealed that a total of 2588 miRNAs were identified. The expression of 80 miRNAs significantly differed between the NAFLD and control groups, including 30 upregulated and 50 downregulated miRNAs. miR-122-5p, miR-27a, and miR-335-5p may play an important role in NAFLD.

SCFA quantitative analysis showed that dietary inulin suppressed faecal acetate levels, but improved propionate and butyrate concentrations in rats with NAFLD. Functional prediction showed that tryptophan metabolism was one of the key metabolic pathways affected by gut microbiota changes. A targeted metabolomics profiling of tryptophan metabolism demonstrated that inulin intervention up-regulated faecal contents of indole-3-acetic acid and kynurenic acid, whereas down-regulated levels of kynurenine and 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid in NAFLD rats.

Quercetin (Que), a flavonoid with strong antioxidant properties, and noticeably reduced the lipid accumulation and the expression of SREBP-1 and XBP-1, as well as of their lipogenic gene targets in steatotic cells. The anti-lipogenic action of Que mainly occurs through a strong phosphorylation of ACACA, which catalyzes the committing step in the DNL pathway. The high level of ACACA phosphorylation in Que-treated cells was explained by the intervention of AMPK together with the reduction of enzymatic activity of PP2A phosphatase.

Actually, we are obligated to pay more attention to the non-diabetic population for early detection and intervention of NAFLD. There is a lack of a convenient tool for predicting NAFLD in non-diabetic adults, and thus we aim to develop and validate a novel clinical nomogram to predict NAFLD among non-diabetic population to save more medical resources and make less missed diagnosis. METHODS: Researchers initially enrolled 20,944 patients and excluded those with history of drinking, known medication usage, viral hepatitis, known liver disease, missing covariant data, age <18 years, and impaired fasting blood glucose, leaving 14,251 adults participating in the baseline analysis, who were randomly divided in a ratio of 3:1 into a training dataset with 10,689 participants and a validation dataset with 3,562 participants, using the classification and regression training (caret) package in R software v. 4.0.3. Variables for prediction were selected by multivariable logistic regression analysis, the LASSO method, and clinical experience. Based on these, we constructed a prediction model. Performance of this model was validated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: We used 6 variables to construct the prediction model: body mass index (BMI), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In the training and validation datasets, the AUROC value of this prediction was 0.891 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.884 to 0.899] and 0.902 (95% CI: 0.890 to 0.914), respectively.

NAFLD-associated HCC usually affects older patients with multiple comorbidities, frequently develops in the absence of cirrhosis, and is often diagnosed later with worse chance of survival. The worse prognosis is also due to limited surveillance strategies and a lower efficacy of standard treatments.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat and high-fructose (HFHFr) diet, with or without SFN gavage at doses of 15 and 30 mg.kg(-1) body weight for 12 weeks. The results showed that SFN reduced weight gain, hepatic inflammation, and steatosis in HFHFr mice. SFN altered the composition of gut microbes. Moreover, SFN enhanced the intestinal tight junction protein ZO-1, reduced serum LPS, and inhibited LPS/TLR4 and ERS pathways to reduce intestinal inflammation. As a result, SFN protected the intestinal integrity and declined the gut-derived LPS translocations to the liver in HFHFr diet-induced mice. SFN decreased the liver LPS levels and inhibited the LPS/TLR4 pathway activations, thus inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Notably, Spearman correlation analysis showed that the protective effect of SFN on intestinal barrier integrity and its anti-inflammatory effect on the liver was associated with improved intestinal dysbiosis.

We evaluate the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and quantify the prognosis in terms of recurrence (DFS) as well as HCC-specific and overall survival (CSS and OS) of patients with and without NAFLD. METHODS: We searched published articles that evaluated the risk and outcomes of HCC in patients with steatosis/steatohepatitis from inception to July 2021 were identified by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Prospective cohort, case-control, or retrospective studies were selected that were published in English and provided incidence and survival rates of HCC patients with NAFLD. A random-effects model was created to estimate the pooled effect size. The primary outcome of interest was HCC incidence. The secondary endpoints were DFS, CSS, and OS. RESULTS: In total, 948 217 patients with NAFLD were analyzed, from n = 103 observational studies. NAFLD significantly increased the risk of HCC (HR = 1.88 [95% CI, 1.46-2.42]; P < .01] but not risk of recurrence (HR = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.85-1.15]; P = .9) or overall mortality (HR = 1.04 [95% CI, 0.88-1.24]; P = 0.64).

RECENT FINDINGS: The work-up for liver abnormalities should be approached systematically in IBD patients, similar to the general population, while still appreciating the differing prevalence of underlying liver diagnoses. Although immune mediated liver diseases occur commonly in patients with IBD, NAFLD is still the most common liver disease in patients with IBD paralleling its expanding prevalence in the general population. IBD is also an independent risk factor for NAFLD, developing in many patients with lower degrees of adiposity. Furthermore, the more severe histologic subtype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, is both more common and difficult to treat considering the lower effectiveness of weight loss interventions.

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study involving 4 031 948 subjects aged 40-69 years who underwent >/=2 health check-ups provided by the National Health Insurance Service in Korea between January 2004 and December 2007. Based on the hepatic steatosis index (HSI), subjects were categorized into non-NAFLD (HSI <30 at all check-ups) and NAFLD (HSI >36 at one or more check-ups). Dementia defined by ICD-10 codes with prescription data was followed up until December 2017. Cox proportional hazards regression models analysed the dementia risk. RESULTS: At baseline, 31.3% had NAFLD. During the median follow-up of 9.5 years, 138 424 in NAFLD group and 69 982 in non-NAFLD group developed dementia.

Logistic regression models estimated the association between hepatic steatosis subtypes and mental symptoms by Odds ratios (OR) adjusted by confounders in the total sample and sex stratified. RESULTS: Among 7241 participants (70.5% men, median age: 45 years), the frequency of steatosis was of 30.7% (25.1% NAFLD), being higher in men than women (70.5% vs. 29.5%, p < 0.0001), regardless of the steatosis subtype. Metabolic risk factors were similar in both subtypes of steatosis, but not mental symptoms. Overall, NAFLD was inversely associated with anxiety (OR = 0.75, 95%CI 0.63-0.90) and positively associated with depression (OR = 1.17, 95%CI 1.00-1.38). On the other hand, ALD was positively associated with anxiety (OR = 1.51; 95%CI 1.15-2.00). In sex-stratified analyses, only men presented an association of anxiety symptoms with NAFLD (OR = 0.73; 95%CI 0.60-0.89) and ALD (OR = 1.60; 95%CI 1.18-2.16).

Using the new consensus-driven definition, we evaluated the association of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with the risk of developing CRC. METHODS: From a nationwide health screening database, we included 8,933,017 participants (48.6% male) aged 40-64 years between 2009 and 2010. Participants were categorized by the presence of fatty liver disease (FLD)-NAFLD and MAFLD, separately-and by the combination of the 2 definitions: neither FLD, NAFLD only, MAFLD only, or both FLD. The primary outcome was the development of CRC. RESULTS: Among the participants, 2,517,330 (28.2%) had NAFLD, and 3,337,122 (37.4%) had MAFLD, whereas 2,465,151 (27.6%) met both NAFLD and MAFLD definitions. Over a median follow-up period of 10.1 years, 60,888 new CRC cases developed. NAFLD and MAFLD were each associated with a significantly higher risk of developing CRC. When the neither FLD group was the reference, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for CRC were 1.16 (1.06-1.28) in the NAFLD only group, 1.18 (1.16-1.20) in the both FLD group, and 1.32 (1.28-1.35) in the MAFLD only group.

METHODOLOGY: This study included 233 participants with metabolic disease over the age of 18 who applied to family medicine clinics. The participants' sociodemographic data, chronic disease status, biochemical parameters, waist circumference, weight, height, body mass index, and presence of steatosis by ultrasonography were recorded. The risk of developing hepatic fibrosis and steatosis was calculated with the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease liver fat score (NAFLD-LFS), hepatic steatosis index (HSI), fatty liver index (FLI), fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), NAFLD fibrosis score (NAFLD-FS), and aspartate aminotransaminase to platelet ratio index (APRI). The conclusions were evaluated with SPSS. RESULTS: According to the diagnostic criteria, MAFLD was detected in 58.4% of the participants. Statistically significant difference was found between FLI, HSI, NAFLD-LFS and MAFLD (p<0.001). According to the steatosis index risk groups of the participants, 64.4% - 89.7% were found to be high-risk. Steatosis was confirmed by ultrasonography in 63.6% - 77.8% of those at high-risk for index steatosis.

Easily applicable and well performing non-invasive fibrosis tests can overcome the limitations of liver biopsy and are of paramount importance to identify at-risk subjects in clinical practice. While tests with optimal performance and ease of use do not exist at this stage, available markers can be divided in three broad groups: simple serum tests, complex serum tests and elastographic methods. Simple scores (such as Fibrosis-4 and NAFLD Fibrosis Score) are based on readily available biochemical data and clinical features, while complex/proprietary tests (such as Fibrotest, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis and Hepascore) directly measure markers of fibrogenesis and fibrolysis, but have higher costs. Elastography techniques estimate the degree of fibrosis from liver stiffness and are based on either ultrasound or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MR elastography has better performance compared with sonographic techniques and is not affected by obesity and inflammation, but is highly costly and less available. In general, non-invasive tests are able to exclude the presence of fibrosis, but their positive predictive value is low to moderate and they lead to a high number of indeterminate results. In this context, a combination of different tests might increase accuracy while reducing gray-zone results. Their ability to predict future events and response to treatment is suboptimal and needs to be studied further.

We recently developed a new index, single point insulin sensitivity estimator (SPISE), based on triglycerides, high-density-lipoprotein and body-mass-index (BMI), and validated by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp-test (EHCT) in adolescents. This study aims to assess the performance of SPISE as an estimation of hepatic insulin (in-)sensitivity. Our results introduce SPISE as a novel and inexpensive index of hepatic insulin resistance, superior to established indices in children and adolescents with obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine pubertal subjects with obesity (13.5 +/- 2.0 years, 59.6% males, overall mean BMI-SDS + 2.8 +/- 0.6) were stratified by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) into a NAFLD (>5% liver-fat-content; male n=41, female n=16) and non-NAFLD (</=5%; male n=18, female n=24) group. Obesity was defined according to WHO criteria (> 2 BMI-SDS). EHCT were used to determine IS in a subgroup (n=17). Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC)-curve was performed for diagnostic ability of SPISE, HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance), and HIRI (hepatic insulin resistance index), assuming null hypothesis of no difference in area-under-the-curve (AUC) at 0.5. RESULTS: SPISE was lower in NAFLD (male: 4.8 +/- 1.2, female: 4.5 +/- 1.1) than in non-NAFLD group (male 6.0 +/- 1.6, female 5.6 +/- 1.5; P< 0.05 95% confidence interval [CI]: male NAFLD 4.5, 5.2; male non-NAFLD 5.2, 6.8; female NAFLD 4.0, 5.1, female non-NAFLD 5.0, 6.2). In males, ROC-AUC was 0.71 for SPISE (P=0.006, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.87), 0.68 for HOMA-IR (P=0.038, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.88), and 0.50 for HIRI (P=0.543, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.74). In females, ROC-AUC was 0.74 for SPISE (P=0.006), 0.59 for HOMA-IR (P=0.214), and 0.68 for HIRI (P=0.072). The optimal cutoff-level for SPISE between NAFLD and non-NAFLD patients was 5.18 overall (Youden-index: 0.35; sensitivity 0.68%, specificity 0.67%).

This study examined sex-specific associations between NAFLD and metabolic factors and investigated the trajectory of risk factors. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 16,140 individuals from Beijing Health Management Cohort. Univariate and multivariate time-dependent Cox regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for new-onset NAFLD. The trajectory of risk factors was investigated using the latent growth curve model and growth mixture model. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 3.15 years, 2,450 (15.18%) participants developed NAFLD. The risk factors for NAFLD in men were increased body mass index (BMI); waist circumference (WC); triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), haemoglobin (Hb), and serum uric acid (SUA) levels; and platelet (PLT) count and decreased serum creatinine-to-body weight (sCr/bw) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In women, the risk factors were increased BMI, WC, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), TG, LDL-C, SUA, white blood cell (WBC), and PLT and decreased sCr/bw and HDL-C levels.

We aimed to evaluate independent associations of NAFLD, especially non-obese or lean NAFLD, and body mass index (BMI) on risks of cancer in patients with T2DM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of baseline information on a cohort of 233 patients with T2DM were conducted in Xiamen, China. NAFLD was identified by hepatic ultrasonography diagnosis of hepatic steatosis without excessive alcohol consumption, viral or autoimmune liver disease. Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score was calculated to quantify severity of hepatic fibrosis. RESULTS: All types of cancers were diagnosed on 19 (8.2%) patients. Prevalence of cancer was significantly higher in those with NAFLD than those without (15.5% vs 4.0%, p=0.002), but were not significantly different among BMI categories (6.8%, 13.7% and 6.5% for those with underweight or normal weight (n=74), overweight (n=51) and obesity (n=108), respectively, p=0.258). With adjustment for potential confounding factors in the multivariable logistic regression models, NAFLD was significantly associated with increased risk of cancer with the adjusted OR (95% CI) of 5.969 (1.349 to 26.413, p=0.019). Stratified analyses across BMI categories found similar association of NAFLD with risk of cancer for those non-obese or lean (the adjusted OR (95% CI) 17.446 (1.690 to 180.095, p=0.016)) but not for those with either overweight (OR (95% CI) 11.642 (0.832 to 162.963, p=0.068) or obesity (OR (95% CI) 0.917 (0.170 to 4.954, p=0.920). FIB-4 score was not significantly associated with risk of cancer for all subjects or stratified across BMI categories. BMI was not significantly associated with risk of cancer for all patients or stratified by NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD, even non-obese or lean NAFLD, was independently associated with increased risk of cancer in patients with T2DM.

Several animal studies have suggested that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) increase NAFLD risk. However, few epidemiological studies have confirmed the association between VOCs, PAHs and NAFLD in the general adolescent population. Therefore, we analyzed 798 adolescents from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS), 2015-2017, to examine the associations of urinary metabolites of VOCs and PAHs with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and NAFLD prevalence. We performed linear regression, logistic regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to evaluate the association of urinary VOCs and PAHs metabolites with ALT levels and NAFLD prevalence. After adjusting for all covariates, urinary benzylmercapturic acid and 2-hydroxyfluorene levels were found to increase ALT activity and NAFLD prevalence. Additionally, the BKMR analyses showed a significantly positive overall effect on ALT activity and NAFLD prevalence with urinary concentrations of VOCs and PAHs metabolites, with 2-hydroxyfluorene as the biggest contributor. Our study suggests that exposure to low-level VOCs and PAHs may have a detrimental effect on NAFLD risk in adolescents.

We performed a single survey of 94 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD to understand baseline physical activity and sedentary behavior, self-perceived fitness, limitations to exercise, potential solutions to increase physical activity behavior, and perception of exercise as a foundational treatment for NAFLD. For exploratory analyses, we evaluated differences in responses to the survey by grouping severity of hepatic fibrosis as follows: nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL); early stage (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH] F0, NASH F1, NASH F2); and late stage (NASH F3, NASH F4). Zero weekly total physical activity was reported by 29% of patients with NAFLD. Late-stage NASH had significantly lower vigorous (P = 0.024), walking (P = 0.029), total weekly activity (P = 0.043), and current fitness level (P = 0.022) compared to early stage NASH. Overall, 72% of patients with NAFLD reported limitations to exercise, with the greatest proportion citing lack of energy (62%), fatigue (61%), prior/current Injury (50%), and shortness of breath (49%). A preference for personal training to increase their physical activity was indicated by 66% of patients with NAFLD, and 63% preferred exercise over medication to treat NAFLD.

Finally, the usefulness of the SRT in comparison with the conventional reporting template (CRT) was judged by 10 gastroenterologists completing the questionnaire. RESULTS: Demographic information and sonography of the liver, gallbladder, and spleen organs were the most critical features. The completeness scores of SRT reports were higher than CRT scores for almost all the factors studied. The difference in the scores was significant for most of the parameters. Moreover, the total completeness score increased from 42% in CRT to 92% in SRT. A comparison of the report adequacy of two reports was seen in all items. The SRT obtained more rates from specialists.

Despite extensive research and multiple clinical trials, there are still no FDA-approved therapies to treat the most severe forms of NAFLD. This is largely due to its complicated etiology and pathogenesis, which involves visceral obesity, insulin resistance, gut dysbiosis, etc. Although inflammation is generally believed to be one of the critical factors that drive the progression of simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the exact type of inflammation and how it contributes to NASH pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Liver inflammation is accompanied by the elevation of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines and consequently intrahepatic infiltration of multiple types of immune cells. Recent studies revealed that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from inflammatory cells and hepatocytes play an important role in controlling liver inflammation during NASH. In this review, we highlight the roles of innate and adaptive immune cells and their microRNA-enriched EVs during NAFLD development and discuss potential drugs that target inflammatory pathways for the treatment of NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36738973/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0163-7258(23)00017-7 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2023.108353", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 35534147, "aid": "S0933-3657(22)00075-6 10.1016/j.artmed.2022.102310", "titl": "Medical checkup data analysis method based on LiNGAM and its application to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.", "mesh": "Data Analysis;;; Disease Progression;;; Humans;;; Male;;; *Metabolic Syndrome/diagnosis/epidemiology;;; Middle Aged;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology;;; Normal Distribution", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Uchida, Tsuyoshi; Fujiwara, Koichi; Nishioji, Kenichi; Kobayashi, Masao; Kano, Manabu; Seko, Yuya; Yamaguchi, Kanji; Itoh, Yoshito; Kadotani, Hiroshi", "jour": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "affl": "Kyoto University, Japan.;;; Nagoya University, Japan.

Missing values in medical checkup data must be appropriately imputed because checkup items vary from person to person, and items that have not been tested include missing values. In addition, the patients with target diseases or disorders are small in comparison with the total number of persons recorded in the data, which means medical checkup data is an imbalanced data analysis. We propose a new method for analyzing the causal relationship in medical checkup data to discover disease progression factors based on a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM), a machine learning technique for causal inference. In the proposed method, specific regression coefficients calculated through LiNGAM were compared to estimate the causal strength of the checkup items on disease progression, which is referred to as LiNGAM-beta. We also propose an analysis framework consisting of LiNGAM-beta, collaborative filtering (CF), and a sampling approach for causal inference of medical checkup data. CF and the sampling approach are useful for missing value imputation and balancing of the data distribution. We applied the proposed analysis framework to medical checkup data for identifying factors of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development. The checkup items related to metabolic syndrome and age showed high causal effects on NAFLD severity. The level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) would have a negative effect on NAFLD severity. Snoring frequency, which is associated with obstructive sleep apnea, affected NAFLD severity, particularly in the male group. Sleep duration also affected NAFLD severity in persons over fifty years old. These analysis results are consistent with previous reports about the causes of NAFLD; for example, NAFLD and metabolic syndrome are mutual and bi-directionally related, and BUN has a negative effect on NAFLD progression. Thus, our analysis result is plausible.

Asperuloside (ASP), a kind of iridoid compound, possesses natural pharmacological effects of anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-obesity. However, whether ASP can improve NAFLD remains unclear. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the effect of ASP on NAFLD mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD), and explore its mechanism in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Pharmacodynamics of ASP was studied by HFD induction in NAFLD mice. HepG2 cells were induced by palmitic acid (PA) as cell model to investigate the effect of ASP on lipid deposition and inflammatory infiltration. Expression of Adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway and NOD-like receptor pyrin containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome were detected by Western blot and RT-PCR. Cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: ASP alleviated liver injury and inflammatory damage in mice with NAFLD. In addition, ASP improved lipid deposition as well as inflammatory response in HFD-induced NAFLD mice and PA-stimulated HepG2 cells. ASP ameliorated lipid deposition and inflammatory response by regulating the p-AMPK/SREBP-1c signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ASP improve lipid deposition and inflammatory infiltration in NAFLD mice via regulating the AMPK/SREBP-1c signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, which may be an effective candidate for the treatment of NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36641101/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0014-2999(23)00015-8 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.ejphar.2023.175504", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Netherlands"}, {"uid": 36735478, "aid": "01445473-202304000-00012 10.1097/LVT.0000000000000060", "titl": "Hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology;;; *Liver Transplantation/adverse effects;;; *Metabolic Syndrome/etiology/complications;;; Risk Factors;;; *Diabetes Mellitus;;; Sirolimus", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Silva, Ana C; Nogueira, Paulo; Machado, Mariana V", "jour": "Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society", "affl": "Gastroenterology Department, Medicine School, Lisbon University, Lisbon, Portugal.;;; Biostatistic Department, Medicine School, Lisbon University, Lisbon, Portugal.;;; Gastroenterology Department, Medicine School, Lisbon University, Lisbon, Portugal.;;; Gastroenterology Department, Vila Franca de Xira Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal.", "pdat": "2023 Apr 1", "tiab": "NAFLD can occur after liver transplantation (LT), as recurrence or de novo hepatic steatosis (HS).

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as a leading cause of HCC, whose rates are increasing, owing to the increasing prevalence of NAFLD. The pathogenesis of NAFLD-associated HCC is multifactorial: insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes and the low-grade hepatic inflammation, which characterizes NAFLD, seem to play key roles in the development and progression of HCC. The diagnosis of NAFLD-associated HCC is based on imaging in the presence of liver cirrhosis, preferably computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, but liver biopsy for histological confirmation is usually required in the absence of liver cirrhosis. Some preventive measures have been recommended for NAFLD-associated HCC, including weight loss, cessation of even moderate alcohol drinking and smoking, as well as the use of metformin, statins and aspirin. However, these preventive measures are mainly based on observational studies, thus they need validation in trials of different design before introducing in clinical practice.

Frailty measures have provided clinical utility in identifying patients at increased risk of poor health outcomes, including those awaiting liver transplantation. However, there is limited data on the prevalence and severity of frailty in patients with non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of frailty and prefrailty in patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD and correlate with severity of liver disease. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of functional and laboratory frailty assessments, including the Fried frailty index (FFI), a self-reported frailty index (SRFI) and a lab-based frailty index (FI-LAB), was performed in a cohort of 109 patients with NAFLD, and results compared with fibrosis staging based on transient elastography. RESULTS: Patients with NAFLD had a high prevalence of prefrailty and frailty, with a median SRFI score of 0.18 (IQR: 0.18), FFI of 1 (IQR: 1) and FI-LAB of 0.18 (IQR: 0.12). Using the SRFI, 45% of F0/F1 patients were classified as prefrail and 20% were classified as frail, while in F2/F3 patients this increased to 36% and 41%, respectively. SRFI, 30 s sit-to-stand and FI-LAB scores increased with increasing liver fibrosis stages (p=0.001, 0.006 and <0.001, respectively). On multivariate linear regression, female gender was identified as a significant predictor of elevated frailty scores.

At pre-and post-intervention, anthropometric measures, metabolic parameters and liver function were assessed. Clinical effectiveness was assessed using Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) and Number Needed to Treat (NNT). RESULTS: After 8 weeks, apart from waist-to-hip ratio, all studied anthropometric measures decreased significantly in each of the groups over the trial. Although the greatest improvements in glycemic indices were observed in MI group (p < 0.05), the differences among the groups were not significant. Control group showed the greatest reduction in serum triglyceride level (p = 0.026) while the greatest improvements in serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were observed in MI group (p = 0.043, p = 0.019 and p = 0.041, respectively). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels reduced significantly in all groups, particularly in propolis group (p = 0.012). The greatest reduction in serum aspartate transaminase (AST) level was observed in control group (p < 0.001), however, the difference among the groups was statistically marginal (p = 0.058).

METHODS: A total of 26,053 patients with NAFLD were identified in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Electronic Health Records from 2004 through 2018. After an average of 5.15 years of follow-up, 395 patients developed HCC after the first measurement of serum magnesium. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of HCC incidence associated with quartile levels of serum magnesium after adjustment for age, sex, race, body mass index, diuretics use, history of type 2 diabetes, history of hypertension, history of hyperlipidemia, and tobacco smoking. RESULTS: Patients with NAFLD who developed HCC had a significantly lower mean (+/- standard deviation) serum magnesium (0.769 +/- 0.131 mmol/L) than those who remained free of HCC (0.789 +/- 0.125 mmol/L; p = .003). Compared with the lowest quartile, the HRs (95% CIs) of HCC second, third, and fourth quartiles of serum magnesium were 0.87 (0.67-1.12), 0.77 (0.57-1.04), and 0.73 (0.56-0.96), respectively, after adjustment for multiple potential confounders (P (trend)  = .02).

Our aim was to re-evaluate the cutoff values of LSM/CAP in Japan and to examine whether LSM/CAP can predict LRE. METHODS: Japanese NAFLD patients (n = 403) who underwent both liver biopsy and VCTE were enrolled. We determined optimal cutoff values of LSM/CAP diagnoses for fibrosis stage and steatosis grade and investigated their clinical outcome based on LSM/CAP values. RESULTS: The LSM cutoff values for F1 to F4 are 7.1, 7.9, 10.0 and 20.2 kPa, and the CAP cutoff values for S1 to S3 are 230, 282 and 320 dB/m.

We aimed to investigate the causal, independent association of lower birthweight with NAFLD and identify potential metabolic mediators and their mediation effects in this association. METHODS: We performed two-step, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for birthweight from the Early Growth Genetics Consortium of 298 142 Europeans, NAFLD from a GWAS meta-analysis of 8434 NAFLD cases and 770 180 controls of Europeans, and 25 candidate mediators from corresponding reliable GWASs. RESULTS: Genetically determined each 1-SD lower birthweight was associated with a 45% (95% CI: 1.25-1.69) increased risk of NAFLD, and this causal association persisted after adjusting for childhood obesity or adult adiposity traits in multivariable MR. Two-step MR identified 6 of 25 candidate mediators partially mediate the effect of lower birthweight on NAFLD, including fasting insulin (proportion mediated: 22.05%), leucine (17.29%), isoleucine (13.55%), valine (11.37%), alanine (10.01%) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; 7.23%). Bidirectional MR suggested a unidirectional effect of insulin resistance on isoleucine, leucine and valine and a unidirectional effect of alanine on insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: This MR study elucidated the causal impact of lower birthweight on subsequent risk of NAFLD, independently of later-life adiposity and identified mediators including insulin resistance, branched-chain amino acids, alanine and MUFA in this association pathway.

To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no safe and effective treatment for the management of this disease. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is an active monomer derived from ginseng and notoginseng. In the present study, HHL\u20115 hepatocytes were used to establish an in vitro cell model of NAFLD by medium\u2011 and long\u2011chain fat emulsion treatment, and the effects of Rg1 on adipose accumulation, apoptosis and the expression levels of apoptosis\u2011related proteins in HHL\u20115 hepatocytes were examined. The results demonstrated that Rg1 inhibited the accumulation of fat in HHL\u20115 cells, while inhibiting apoptosis, and Rg1 downregulated the expression levels of the pro\u2011apoptotic protein Bax and upregulated the expression levels of the anti\u2011apoptotic protein Bcl\u20112, indicating that Rg1 could promote the stability or integrity of mitochondria and exert an anti\u2011apoptotic effect by regulating Bcl\u20112 family proteins. In addition, Rg1 markedly downregulated the expression levels of sphingosine\u20111\u2011phosphate lyase 1 (SGPL1), a key enzyme in the sphingosine signaling pathway, in HHL\u20115 cells with steatosis, and increased the expression levels of the downstream pro\u2011survival signals phosphorylated (p\u2011)Akt and p\u2011Erk1/2. Furthermore, overexpression of SGPL1 abolished the anti\u2011apoptotic effect of Rg1 on SGPL1\u2011overexpressing HHL\u20115 cells with steatosis, and downregulated the expression levels of pro\u2011survival proteins, such as Bcl\u20112, p\u2011Akt and p\u2011Erk1/2, whereas the expression levels of pro\u2011apoptotic Bax were markedly increased. In conclusion, although there are some reports regarding the protective effect of Rg1 on fatty liver cells, to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report that Rg1 may exert an anti\u2011apoptotic effect on fatty liver cells by regulating SGPL1 in the sphingosine signaling pathway.

METHODS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was induced in mice using our patented feed and 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) was performed. Mice were sacrificed 0, 4, 8, 24, or 48 hours, or 7 days after PH, and liver regeneration and the mRNA expression of ER stress markers were assessed. RESULTS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score was calculated as 4-6 points for NAFL and 7 points for NASH. NASH was characterized by inflammation and high ER stress marker expression before PH. After PH, NASH mice showed poorer liver regeneration than controls. High expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes was present in NASH mice 4 hours after PH. Xbp1-s mRNA expression was high in control and NAFL mice after PH, but no higher in NASH mice.

The gut microbiome and metabolic products were altered after oral P.g administration. P.g and ferroptosis were observed in the livers of the mice after oral P.g administration. Additionally, ferroptosis was observed in hepatocytes in vitro, but it was reversed by ferroptosis inhibitors. In addition, P.g triggered an imbalance in the Th17/Treg ratio in the liver and spleen in vivo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: NAFLD- and AF- related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified via bioinformatic analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE63067 and GSE79768, respectively. Further enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, the identification of significant hub genes, and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis were conducted. The gene-disease interactions were analyzed using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. In addition, the hub genes were validated by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) in NAFLD cell model. RESULTS: A total of 45 co-expressed differentially expressed genes (co-DEGs) were identified between the NAFLD/AF and healthy control individuals. GO and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that the co-DEGs were mostly enriched in neutrophil activation involved in the immune response and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. Moreover, eight hub genes were selected owing to their high degree of connectivity and upregulation in both the NAFLD and AF datasets. These genes included CCR2, PTPRC, CXCR2, MNDA, S100A9, NCF2, S100A12, and S100A8. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we conducted the gene differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and PPI analysis of DEGs in AF and NAFLD, which provides novel insights into the identification of potential biomarkers and valuable therapeutic leads for AF and NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35790963/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1186/s12920-022-01300-1 https://sci-hub.do/1300 https://sci-hub.do/10.1186/s12920-022-01300-1", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 36754244, "aid": "S0925-4439(23)00028-5 10.1016/j.bbadis.2023.166662", "titl": "Pharmacological inhibition of CFTR attenuates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) progression in mice.", "mesh": "Animals;;; Humans;;; Mice;;; *Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics;;; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/genetics;;; Fibrosis;;; *Liver Neoplasms/pathology;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Rajak, Sangam; Tewari, Archana; Raza, Sana; Gupta, Pratima; Chakravarti, Bandana; Anjum, Baby; Tripathi, Madhulika; Singh, Brijesh K; Yen, Paul M; Goel, Amit; Ghosh, Sujoy; Sinha, Rohit A", "jour": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Presently, there are no approved drugs for NASH treatment, which has become a leading cause of liver transplants worldwide.

We analysed the effect of empagliflozi, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and ezetimibe on developing hepatic steatosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using 4005,779 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or dyslipidemia provided by the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) between January 2015 and December 2015, we analyzed the odds ratio (OR) of fatty liver development (fatty liver index [FLI] >60). Additionally, we examined the metabolic effects of ezetimibe and empagliflozin in mice fed with a choline-deficient high-fat diet, mimicking the features of human NAFLD. The experiment for agents was performed for the non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mouse models independently. In the NHIS data, ORs for the development of fatty liver were significantly lower in all treatment groups than in the reference group, which did not receive ezetimibe or empagliflozin. (Ezetimibe therapy; OR=0.962, empagliflozin therapy; OR=0.527, ezetimibe plus empagliflozin; OR=0.509 compared to reference therapy). Unlike non-alcoholic steatohepatitis mouse model, ezetimibe, empagliflozin, and combination therapy also reduced liver steatosis in the non-alcoholic fatty liver mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other agents, empagliflozin and/or ezetimibe treatment reduced the risk of developing hepatic steatosis.

The median interval between the first and second liver biopsies was 2.9 years. RESULTS: The fibrosis stage scores indicated progression, no change, and improvement (a decrease of one point or more) in 21.0%, 56.8%, and 22.2% of the patients, respectively. There were 64 patients in the high-risk group who had no improvement in stage scores. Among these, the miR-122 levels were significantly lower in 7 patients with liver cancer than those of the 54 patients who had no liver cancer at the second liver biopsy. The cumulative rates of liver cancer were significantly higher in cases with miR-122 ratios <0.5 (serum miR-122 level at second biopsy to that at first biopsy) than those with ratios >/=0.5. The cumulative survival rates in cases with miR-122 ratios <0.5 tended to be lower than those with ratios >/=0.5. Of the 64 high-risk patients, 39 indicated stage 2 or greater (severe fibrosis stage) at the first liver biopsy and also showed similar results of cumulative liver cancer and survival rates.

Ginsenoside CK has been investigated given its various pharmacological activities, but its effects against NAFLD and the underlying mechanism are still unclear. In this study, fructose was used to simulate hepatic fatty degeneration in vivo, while palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA) were applied to induce lipid accumulation in vitro. The level of lipid accumulation in hepatic tissue and HepG2 cells was evaluated by Oil Red O staining. Detection of serum and liver biomarkers, western blotting, and real-time qPCR were conducted to assess the degree of hepatic steatosis. Our results indicated that ginsenoside CK could decrease the lipid deposition in HepG2 cells, retard the increase of body weight of fructose-fed mice, alleviate the lipid accumulation in serum and hepatic tissue and improve the hepatic inflammation and injury. Mechanically, ginsenoside CK modulated the expression of factors correlated with lipid synthesis and metabolism in vitro and in vivo via activating the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess whether the severity of fibrosis in NAFLD subjects was associated with extra-hepatic diseases based on noninvasive markers in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: The study population included a cohort of 118,664 participants from the nationwide CONSTANCES cohort. After excluding individuals with excessive alcohol consumption and other causes of liver disease, 102,344 were included. The noninvasive diagnosis of NAFLD and fibrosis was performed using a combination of the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and the Forns Index. The history of CVD or EHC was recorded by a physician, and CKD was defined by a glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/mn. RESULTS: The prevalence of NAFLD (FLI > 60) was 18.2%, 10% with mild fibrosis (Forns Index < 4.2), 7.7% with intermediate fibrosis (Forns Index 4.2-6.9), and 0.4% with advanced fibrosis (Forns Index > 6.9). The prevalence of CVD, EHC, or CKD increased significantly with the severity of fibrosis (p < 0.0001). When adjusted for demographic, metabolic risk factors, and smoking, NAFLD with intermediate or advanced fibrosis remained associated with CVD (OR 1.36, p < 0.0001 and OR 3.07, p < 0.0001, respectively), EHC (OR 1.24, p = 0.001 and OR 1.64, p = 0.004, respectively), and CKD (OR 1.18, p = 0.03 and OR 2.09, p < 0.0001, respectively).

DATA SOURCES.-: A literature search was performed using the PubMed search engine. The terms ''steatosis,'' ''steatohepatitis,'' ''nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),'' ''nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),'' \"alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH),\" ''type 2 diabetes (T2DM),'' \"cryptogenic cirrhosis,\" \"drug-induced liver injury (DILI),\" \"immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy,\" and \"COVID-19 and liver\" were used. CONCLUSIONS.-: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has become the most common chronic liver disease in the United States. NASH is the progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The hallmarks of steatohepatitis are steatosis, ballooned hepatocytes, and lobular inflammation. NASH and alcoholic steatohepatitis share similar histologic features, but some subtle differences may help their distinction. NASH is commonly seen in patients with metabolic dysfunction but can also be caused by other etiologies. Examples are medications including newly developed immune checkpoint inhibitors and viral infections such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NASH is also a common cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis but can be reversed.

The present study aimed to examine the association between DDS and its components and NAFLD among Iranian adults. METHODS: In the case-control study, we enrolled 121 newly diagnosed cases of NAFLD and 122 with age, BMI and sex-matched controls. All NAFLD patients were diagnosed through ultrasonography methods by gastroenterologists. Anthropometric parameters of participants including weight, height, hip circumference and waist circumference were measured. A validated 147-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was applied to assess the usual dietary intakes of participants. Binary logistic regression was conducted to estimate the risk of NAFLD in relation to DDS and its components, including refined grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy and meats. RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 42.7 years of them 53.1% were male. Higher adherence to DDS [odds ratio (OR) = 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.25-0.95] and vegetable group (OR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.71) were remarkably associated with lower risk of NAFLD, after adjusting for several confounders including age, BMI, physical activity, energy intake, job, education, and antihypertensive drugs usage. Contrastingly, greater adherence to the refined grain (OR = 3.36; 95% CI, 1.44-7.87) and meat group (OR = 3.27; 95% CI, 1.25-6.90) was significantly associated with increased risk of NAFLD.

AIMS: We conducted a study with the objective of describing the association between the baseline Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 among patients at risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with at least two risk factors for metabolic syndrome diagnosed with COVID-19. The main exposure of interest was FIB-4 index prior to infection, categorized into three previously validated age-specific levels. The main outcomes of interest were disease requiring hospitalization and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We included 373 patients [median age, 62 years; 194 male (52%); median number of metabolic syndrome risk factors, 3]. The median FIB-4 index was 1.10 (interquartile range 0.78-1.61).

We used cohort data of the Japan Obesity and Metabolic syndrome Study and examined the correlation between body weight (BW) loss (BW loss) and changes in the FIB4 index (DeltaFIB4 index) in patients who successfully reduced their BW by more than 5% from baseline BW after 3, 6, and 12 months (M) of weight reduction therapy. A negative correlation (r = -0.342, p = 0.029) was observed between BW loss and FIB4 index after 3 M, but not after 6 M, whereas a positive correlation (r = 0.298, p = 0.03) was noted after 12 M. These results revealed changes in the correlation between DeltaBW loss and DeltaFIB4 index during the therapy, mainly due to time-dependent changes in components of the FIB4 index formula. Thus, we concluded that the FIB4 index is useful and reliable to assess liver fibrosis until 3 M during weight reduction therapy. However, after 3 M, we should recognize that the FIB4 index may not reflect liver status.

METHODS: A review of liver biopsy slides was performed in children with a clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of WD, seen at the Hospital for Sick Children between 1981 and 2019 and compared to controls with NAFLD and AIH. 37 children with WD and 37 disease controls (20 NAFLD; 17 AIH) were included. Three pathologists, blind to clinical details and diagnosis, reviewed all liver biopsies to reach consensus. Clinical and histopathologic features were compared between groups. RESULTS: Most WD cases displayed steatosis or steatohepatitis on histology (34/37), active AIH-pattern in 1 and inactive cirrhosis in 2 cases. Electron microscopy (EM) findings of mitochondrial abnormalities including dilated tips of cristae, pleomorphism, membrane duplication and dense matrix were more frequent in the WD group as compared to disease controls (p < 0.0001). In WD, dilated tips of mitochondrial cristae had a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 86%, best among EM features.

In this study, we demonstrated the role of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORalpha) in the maintenance of genomic integrity, particularly in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, using the high-fat diet (HFD)-fed liver-specific RORalpha knockout (RORalpha-LKO) mouse model. First, we observed that the loss of hepatic retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORalpha) accelerated hepatocyte nuclear polyploidization after HFD feeding. In 70% partial hepatectomy experiments, enrichment of hepatocyte polyploidy was more obvious in the RORalpha-LKO animals, which was accompanied by early progression to the S phase and blockade of the G2/M transition, suggesting a potential role of RORalpha in suppressing hepatocyte polyploidization in the regenerating liver. An analysis of a publicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq dataset, together with the Search Tool of the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database resource, revealed that DNA endoreplication was the top-enriched biological process Gene Ontology term. Furthermore, we found that E2f7 and E2f8, which encode key transcription factors for DNA endoreplication, were the downstream targets of RORalpha-induced transcriptional repression. Finally, we showed that the administration of JC1-40, an RORalpha activator (5 mg/kg body wt), significantly reduced hepatic nuclear polyploidization in the HFD-fed mice. Together, our observations suggest that the RORalpha-induced suppression of hepatic polyploidization may provide new insights into the pathological polyploidy of NAFLD and may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NAFLD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY It has been reported that hepatic polyploidization is closely linked to the progression of NAFLD.

The mechanism could be the RORalpha-mediated repression of E2f7 and E2f8, key transcription factors for DNA endoreplication.

Emerging data suggest that PLWH are at high risk for developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this review is to examine the current literature and provide an accurate estimate of the prevalence of NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and fibrosis, and identify potential risk factors for NAFLD in PLWH. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase databases to identify studies reporting the prevalence of NAFLD and/or fibrosis in PLWH monoinfection. We performed a random effects meta-analysis of proportions to estimate the pooled prevalence of NAFLD, NASH, and fibrosis among PLWH monoinfection. We also examined potential risk factors for NAFLD by comparing characteristics of PLWH monoinfection with and without NAFLD. RESULTS: A total of 43 studies, reporting data for 8230 patients, met our eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Based on imaging studies the overall pooled prevalence of NAFLD and moderate liver fibrosis (METAVIR >/= F2) among PLWH monoinfection was 33.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29.67%-38.39%), and 12.00% (95% CI, 10.02%-14.12%), respectively. Based on biopsy studies, prevalence of NASH and significant liver fibrosis (stage >/=F2 on histology) was 48.77% (95% CI, 34.30%-63.34%) and 23.34% (95% CI, 14.98%-32.75%), respectively. Traditional metabolic syndrome and HIV-related factors were associated with NAFLD in PLWH. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the burden of NAFLD, NASH, and fibrosis is high among PLWH monoinfection.

A total of 3363 participants aged 20-79 years were recruited and admitted from January 20, 2018, to October 16, 2020. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed using abdominal ultrasonography. The outcome was the association between daytime sleep duration and the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. RESULTS: Compared with non-nappers, long daytime nappers (>/= 60 min) were associated with a higher risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the crude model (odds ratio 2.138; 95% confidence interval 1.88-2.61, P < 0.05) and in the multivariable adjustment model (odds ratio 2.211; 95% confidence interval 1.042-4.690, P < 0.05) after adjusting for demographic, educational, and metabolic risk factors.

Since no effective therapeutic drugs are available to cope with this widespread epidemic, the functional research of genes with altered expression during NAFLD helps understand the pathogenesis of this disease and the development of new potential therapeutic targets for drugs. In the current work, we discovered via the analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset that cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) decreased significantly in NAFLD patients, which was also confirmed in multiple NAFLD mouse models (HFD-fed C57BL/6J, db/db and HFHFrHC-fed C57BL/6J mice). Next, CSAD's function in the progression of NAFLD was explored using AAV-mediated liver-directed gene overexpression in an HFD-fed mouse model, where the overexpression of CSAD in the liver could alleviate NAFLD-associated pathologies, including body weight, liver/body weight ratio, hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol, and the degree of steatosis. Mechanically, we found that the overexpression of CSAD could increase the expression of some genes related to fatty acid beta-oxidation (Acad1, Ppara, and Acox1). Furthermore, we also detected that CSAD could improve mitochondrial injury in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we proposed that the effect of CSAD on lipid accumulation might be independent of the taurine pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrated that CSAD is involved in the development of NAFLD as a protective factor, which suggested that CSAD has the potential to become a new target for drug discovery in NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36555571/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/ijms232415931 https://sci-hub.do/ijms-23-15931 https://sci-hub.do/10.3390/ijms232415931", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "Switzerland"}, {"uid": 35085026, "aid": "10.1089/met.2021.0104", "titl": "Clinicopathological Profile and Outcome of a Large Cohort of Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease from South Asia: Interim Results of the Indian Consortium on Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.", "mesh": "Adult;;; Aspartate Aminotransferases;;; Biopsy/adverse effects;;; Fibrosis;;; Humans;;; India/epidemiology;;; Liver/pathology;;; Liver Cirrhosis/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology;;; Male;;; Middle Aged;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Duseja, Ajay; Singh, Shivaram P; Mehta, Manu; Shalimar; Venkataraman, Jayanthi; Mehta, Varun; Devadas, Krishnadas; Kar, Sanjib K; Goyal, Omesh; Nagral, Aabha; Saigal, Sanjiv; Nijhawan, Sandeep; Praharaj, Dibyalochan; Shukla, Akash; Sharma, Brij; Narayanasamy, Krishnasamy; Kumar, Pramod; Rao, Padaki Nagaraja; Arora, Anil; Mehta, Rajiv; Asati, Pankaj; Ranjan, Piyush; Koshy, Abraham; Alam, Seema; Mukewar, Shrikant; Mukewar, Saurabh; Mohan Prasad, Virukalpatti Gopalratnam; Rastogi, Mukul; Sanyal, Arun J", "jour": "Metabolic syndrome and related disorders", "affl": "Department of Hepatology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology, SCB Medical College, Cuttack, India.;;; Department of Hepatology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.;;; Department of Hepatology, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research, Chennai, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology, Government Medical College, Trivandrum, India.;;; Gastro Liver Care, Cuttack, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India.;;; Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, India.;;; Medanta, The Medicity, Gurugram, India.;;; SMS Medical College and Hospital, Jaipur, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneshwar, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology, Seth GSMC & KEM Hospital, Mumbai, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology, Indira Gandhi Medical College & Hospital, Shimla, India.;;; Department of Hepatology, Madras Medical College, Chennai, India.;;; Centre of Liver Sciences, AIG Hospitals, Hyderabad, India.;;; Centre of Liver Sciences, AIG Hospitals, Hyderabad, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology, Surat Institute of Digestive Sciences, Surat, India.;;; NSC Bose Medical College and Hospital, Jabalpur, India.;;; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, India.;;; Department of Hepatology, VPS Lakeshore, Kochi, India.;;; Department of Pediatric Hepatology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India.;;; MIDAS Hospital, Nagpur, India.;;; MIDAS Hospital, Nagpur, India.;;; VGM Hospital, Institute of Gastroenterology, Coimbatore, India.;;; Department of Hepatology, Gastroenterology and Liver Transplant, Fortis Hospital, Noida, India.;;; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Apr", "tiab": "Background: Previous data from South Asia and India had shown that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have mild liver disease severity.

However, its beneficial effects on NAFLD and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that WTE alleviated obesity, lipid accumulation, hepatic steatosis, and liver injury in a mouse model of NAFLD. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that WTE exerted the anti-NAFLD effect by decreasing the expression of genes involved in lipid transport and synthesis processes while activating genes associated with energy expenditure. In addition, a comparison of the transcriptional responses of WTE with that of green tea extract (GTE) revealed that WTE can not only regulate lipid metabolism and stress response like GTE but also regulate antioxidant and inflammatory pathways more effectively.

Fracture is a major clinical problem in older people, but few large-scale cohort studies have evaluated the relationship between NAFLD and fracture. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether the fatty liver index (FLI), which represents the severity of NAFLD, can predict fracture risk. METHODS: We analyzed the relationship between the FLI and incident fracture using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and data for 180,519 individuals who underwent National Health check-ups in the Republic of Korea between 2009 and 2014. RESULTS: A total of 2,720 participants (1.5%) were newly diagnosed with fracture during the study period (median 4.6 years). The participants were grouped according to FLI quartiles (Q1, 0 to <5.653; Q2, 5.653 to <15.245; Q3, 15.245 to <37.199; and Q4 >/=37.199). The cumulative fracture incidence was significantly higher in the highest FLI group than in the lowest FLI group (Q4, 986 [2.2%] and Q1, 323 [0.7%]; p<0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio indicated that the highest FLI group was independently associated with a higher incidence of fracture (hazard ratio for Q4 vs Q1, 2.956; 95% confidence interval, 2.606 to 3.351; p<0.001).

Part of which is explained by insulin resistance (IR) ('MetComp') and part by common modifiers of genetic risk ('GenComp'). We examined how IR on the one hand and genetic risk on the other contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. METHODS: We studied 846 individuals: 492 were obese patients with liver histology and 354 were individuals who underwent intrahepatic triglyceride measurement by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A genetic risk score was calculated using the number of risk alleles in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, MBOAT7, HSD17B13 and MARC1. Substrate concentrations were assessed by serum NMR metabolomics. In subsets of participants, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and their flux were assessed by D(5)-glycerol and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (n = 41), and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) was measured by D(2)O (n = 61). RESULTS: We found that substrate surplus (increased concentrations of 28 serum metabolites including glucose, glycolytic intermediates, and amino acids; increased NEFAs and their flux; increased DNL) characterized the 'MetComp'. In contrast, the 'GenComp' was not accompanied by any substrate excess but was characterized by an increased hepatic mitochondrial redox state, as determined by serum beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio, and inhibition of hepatic pathways dependent on tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, such as DNL. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio correlated strongly with all histological features of NAFLD. IR and hepatic mitochondrial redox state conferred additive increases in histological features of NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the mechanisms underlying 'Metabolic' and 'Genetic' components of NAFLD are fundamentally different. These findings may have implications with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD. LAY SUMMARY: The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can be explained in part by a metabolic component, including obesity, and in part by a genetic component. Herein, we demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying these components are fundamentally different: the metabolic component is characterized by hepatic oversupply of substrates, such as sugars, lipids and amino acids. In contrast, the genetic component is characterized by impaired hepatic mitochondrial function, making the liver less able to metabolize these substrates.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34710482/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0168-8278(21)02150-4 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jhep.2021.10.013", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Netherlands"}, {"uid": 35240510, "aid": "S0006-291X(22)00222-4 10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.02.033", "titl": "Inulin activates FXR-FGF15 signaling and further increases bile acids excretion in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease mice.", "mesh": "Animals;;; Bile Acids and Salts/metabolism;;; Cholesterol/metabolism;;; Humans;;; Inulin/metabolism/pharmacology;;; Liver/metabolism;;; Mice;;; Mice, Inbred C57BL;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/drug therapy/metabolism", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Wang, Rui; Ren, Yi; Bao, Ting; Wang, Ting; Li, Yiwei; Liu, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Xiaoxia; Yang, Shaoqi; Wang, Hao", "jour": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "affl": "Clinical Medical College, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.;;; Clinical Medical College, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.;;; The Third People's Hospital of Ningxia, Yinchuan, China.;;; Department of Pathogenic Biology and Medical Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.;;; Department of Pathogenic Biology and Medical Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.;;; Department of Pathogenic Biology and Medical Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.;;; College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.

However, the underlying mechanism(s) of the beneficial role of NAC is still not fully understood. Our study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of NAC against NAFLD in terms of gut microbiota homeostasis. Thirty-two C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups, including chow diet (CHOW), high-fat diet (HFD), CHOW + NAC (2 g L(-1) in the drinking water), and HFD + NAC groups, and fed for 12 weeks. NAC supplementation significantly improved HFD-induced obesity, dyslipidemia, and liver dysfunction in mice. NAC also rescued HFD-caused disorder of the gut microbiota. Intriguingly, removing intestinal microorganisms by antibiotics (ABX) obviously abolished NAC supplementation-rescued hepatic steatosis and liver injury, indicating the involvement of the gut microbiota in the beneficial role of NAC. The profiles of 1145 expressed hepatic mRNAs were analyzed by whole transcriptome sequencing. Among those, 5 up-expressed mRNAs induced by a HFD, including Cidea, CD36, Acnat2, Mogat1, and GPAT3, were reversed by NAC treatment, which was further verified by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Meanwhile, those 5 mRNAs exhibited a significant (negative or positive) association with bacterial phyla or genera, including phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and genera norank_f_Erysipelotrichaceae and Lachnoclostridium, by Spearman's correlation analysis.

Vitamin D is a possible mediator. In the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes study (D2d), we investigated the relationship of baseline indices of NAFLD with incident T2D and whether the effect of vitamin D on diabetes was modified by NAFLD. METHODS: Cross-sectional associations of indices of NAFLD with glycemia and vitamin D status were assessed in 3972 individuals screened for the D2d study. In those with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D or placebo (n = 2423), we examined longitudinal associations of NAFLD indices with incident T2D. We used validated non-invasive scores to assess steatosis [(hepatic steatosis index (HSI); NAFLD-liver fat score (NAFLD-LFS)] and advanced fibrosis [fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index; AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI)]. RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of screened participants had likely steatosis by HSI and 71 % by NAFLD-LFS; 3 % were likely to have advanced fibrosis by FIB-4 and 1.2 % by APRI. FIB-4 indicated that 20.4 % of individuals require further follow up to assess liver health. Steatosis and fibrosis scores were higher among participants with worse glycemia. The NAFLD-LFS and APRI predicted development of diabetes (hazard ratios [95%CI] 1.35 [1.07, 1.70]; P = 0.012) and 2.36 (1.23, 4.54; P = 0.010), respectively). The effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was not modified by baseline NAFLD indices. Individuals with likely steatosis had a smaller increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in response to vitamin D than those without steatosis.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] is a common co-existing condition, possibly contributing to the cardio-metabolic burden and overall morbidity. Epsilonmerging therapeutic choices of biologic agents have modified the clinical course of IBD; however, their impact on IBD-associated NAFLD has not been extensively evaluated. The prevalence of NAFLD varies among IBD patients, but it appears higher than in the general population in the majority of quality studies. In terms of pathogenetic and risk factors of NAFLD, they may vary with IBD activity. Dysbiosis, mucosal damage, and cytokine release have been implicated in the pathogenesis during the relapses, whereas metabolic risk factors seem to play a dominant role during the remissions of IBD. Considering biologics, although quality data are scarce, agents suppressing tumour necrosis factor may offer potential benefits in IBD-associated NAFLD, whereas anti-integrins do not appear to confer any therapeutic advantage.

This study explores the relationship between FLI and HUA in hypertensive patients. METHODS: A total of 13,716 hypertensive subjects were included in the current study. FLI, a simple index calculated from triglycerides (TG), waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), and gamma -glutamyltransferase (GGT), was used as a useful predictor of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) distribution. HUA was defined as serum uric acid >/= 360 mumol/L for females and >/= 420 mumol/L for males. RESULTS: The mean value of total FLI was 31.8 +/- 25.1. Multiple logistic analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between FLI and HUA (OR, 1.78; 95% CI: 1.69-1.87). A subgroup analysis demonstrated that the correlation between FLI (< 30 vs. >/= 30) and HUA was significant in both sexes (P for interaction = 0.006). Further analyses stratified by sex indicated a positive correlation between FLI and HUA prevalence among male and female subjects. However, the correlation between FLI and HUA was stronger in female subjects than in males (male: OR, 1.70; 95% CI: 1.58-1.83; female: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.73-1.98).

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study comprising 100 patients with T2DM and 100 non-T2DM individuals, matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Transient elastography was used to assess hepatic steatosis and liver stiffness measurements (LSM). Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was used to quantify hepatic steatosis. To distinguish grades of hepatic steatosis, cutoff values were as follows: S1 >/= 302, S2 >/= 331, and S3 >/= 337 dB/m. Moreover, VAT area was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in accordance with validated protocols. RESULTS: CAP score was significantly higher in participants with T2DM (294.61 +/- 3.82 vs. 269.86 +/- 3.86 dB/ m; P < 0.001). Furthermore, 42% of participants with T2DM had hepatic steatosis (S > S1: 302 dB/m), while this figure was 26% in non-T2DM group (P < 0.003). The mean liver stiffness measurement was also significantly higher in patients with T2DM (5.53 vs. 4.79 kPa; P < 0.001). VAT area was greater in patients with T2DM compared to non-T2DM individuals: 163.79 +/- 47.98 cm(2) versus 147.49 +/- 39.09 cm(2), P = 0.009. However, total and truncal fat mass were not different between the two groups. Age, BMI, waist circumference, ALT, CAP, and LSM were significantly associated with VAT area. BMI and VAT area were the important determinants of steatosis in both groups of participants with and without T2DM. Moreover, the VAT area was associated with the severity of hepatic steatosis and liver stiffness, independent of anthropometric measures of obesity.

We performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We collected data using PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Web of Science from the databases' inception until December 2022. We included cohort studies in which lean NAFLD was diagnosed through imaging methods or biopsy. Eligible studies were selected according to predefined keywords and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 16 observational studies with 304,975 adult individuals (7.7% with lean NAFLD) and nearly 1300 cases of incident diabetes followed up over a median period of 5.05 years were included in the final analysis. Patients with lean NAFLD had a greater risk of incident diabetes than those without NAFLD (random-effects hazard ratio [HR] 2.72, 95% CI 1.56-4.74; I(2) = 93.8%). Compared with the lean without NAFLD group, the adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of incident diabetes for participants in the overweight/obese without NAFLD and overweight/obese with NAFLD groups were 1.32 (0.99- 1.77) and 2.98(1.66-5.32). It appeared to be even greater among NAFLD patients with advanced high NAFLD fibrosis score (random-effects HR 3.48, 95% CI 1.92-6.31). Sensitivity analyses and publication bias did not alter these findings.

To date, no medication has been approved to treat NAFLD. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of the natural flavone acacetin on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD in mice and the underlying mechanisms. We found that acacetin (10, 20, 50 mg/kg/day) suppressed the increase in body weight, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels in mice fed with HFD with a dose-dependent manner. Hepatic lipid accumulation, iron overload, and lipid peroxidation were significantly alleviated by acacetin. Quantitative PCR and western blotting revealed that acacetin inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ferroptosis, and expressions of lipid acid synthesis-related genes in the livers of HFD mice. Similar results were observed in HepG2 cells treated with oleic acid and lipopolysaccharide. The suppressive effects of acacetin on triglycerides and expression of lipid acid synthesis genes were abolished by ER stress and the ferroptosis activators, erastin or TU. Interestingly, the action of TU was more potent than that of erastin. Treatment with the ER stress inhibitor GSK and the ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 revealed that ER stress was the upstream signal of ferroptosis for hepatic lipid accumulation. These findings suggest the protective effect of acacetin against lipid accumulation via suppressing ER stress and ferroptosis and provide evidence that ER stress is an upstream signal of ferroptosis in lipid accumulation.

This meta-analysis will be the first to examine the echocardiographic-derived cardiac function and structural characteristics in NAFLD patients, and its association with liver disease severity and metabolic profile. METHODS: Medline and Embase were searched and pairwise meta-analysis was conducted in DerSimonian and Laird to obtain the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively, to compare the effects of NAFLD on the echocardiography parameters. RESULTS: Forty-one articles involving 33,891 patients underwent echocardiography. NAFLD patients had worse systolic indices with lower ejection fraction (EF, MD: - 0.693; 95% CI: - 1.112 to - 0.274; p = 0.001), and worse diastolic indices with higher E/e' (MD: 1.575; 95% CI: 0.924 to 2.227; p < 0.001) compared to non-NAFLD patients. NAFLD patients displayed increased left ventricular mass (LVM, MD: 34.484; 95% CI: 26.236 to 42.732; p < 0.001) and epicardial adipose thickness (EAT, MD: 0.1343; 95% CI: 0.055 to 0.214; p = 0.001).

METHODS: NAFLD was induced by feeding rats high-fat-fructose-diet (HFFD) for 6 weeks. Rats were then randomly assigned to three groups (n = 6 each); NAFLD group continued on HFFD for another 8 weeks. CR group was switched to CR diet (25% calorie restriction) for 8 weeks and RK group was switched to normal diet and received RK (55 mg/kg/day; orally) for 8 weeks. Another six rats were used as normal control. KEY FINDINGS: HFFD induced a state of NAFLD indicated by increased fat deposition in liver tissue along with dyslipidemia, elevated liver enzymes, oxidative stress and inflammation. Either CR diet or RK reversed these changes and decreased HFFD-induced elevation of hepatic SphK1, S1P, S1PR1 and TLR4. Of notice, RK along with a normal calorie diet was even better than CR alone in most studied parameters. CONCLUSIONS: SphK1/S1P and TLR4 are interconnected and related to the establishment of HFFD-induced NAFLD and can be modulated by RK.

METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice (N = 40) were fed a standard Chow (n = 20) or an HFHC (n = 20) diet for 15 weeks. After 8 weeks of dietary treatment, they were further assigned to 4 subgroups for the remaining 7 weeks: Chow (n = 10), Chow plus exercise (Chow+EX, n = 10), HFHC (n = 10), or HFHC plus exercise (HFHC+EX, n = 10). Both Chow+EX and HFHC+EX mice were subjected to treadmill running. RESULTS: Chronic exposure to the HFHC diet resulted in obesity with hepatic steatosis, impaired glucose tolerance, and elevated liver enzymes. The HFHC significantly increased fibrotic area (p &lt; 0.001), increased the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha (4.1-fold, p &lt; 0.001), IL-1beta (5.0-fold, p &lt; 0.001), col1a1 (8.1-fold, p &lt; 0.001), and Timp1 (6.0-fold, p &lt; 0.001) in the lung tissue.

To determine the optimal testing strategy for NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis, several factors such as diagnostic accuracy, failure rates, costs of examinations, and potential treatment options need to be considered. The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of combination testing involving vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) versus magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) as a frontline imaging strategy for NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis. METHODS: A Markov model was developed from the US perspective. The base-case scenario in this model included patients aged 50 years with a Fibrosis-4 score of >/=2.67 and suspected advanced fibrosis. The model included a decision tree and a Markov state-transition model including 5 health states: fibrosis stage 1-2, advanced fibrosis, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and death. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Staging fibrosis with MRE cost $8388 more than VCTE but led to an additional 1.19 Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $7048/QALY. The cost-effectiveness analysis of the 5 strategies revealed that MRE+biopsy and VCTE+MRE+biopsy were the most cost-effective with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $8054/QALY and $8241/QALY, respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses indicated that MRE remained cost-effective with a sensitivity of >/=0.77, whereas VCTE became cost-effective with a sensitivity of >/=0.82. CONCLUSIONS: MRE was not only cost-effective than VCTE as the frontline modality for staging NAFLD patients with Fibrosis-4 >/=2.67 with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $7048/QALY but also remained cost-effective when used as a follow-up in instances of VCTE failure to diagnose.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37018145/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/01515467-202305000-00024 https://sci-hub.do/10.1097/HEP.0000000000000262", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United States"}, {"uid": 36328906, "aid": "S1043-2760(22)00182-5 10.1016/j.tem.2022.10.004", "titl": "SIRT6: therapeutic target for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/drug therapy/metabolism;;; Liver/metabolism;;; Fatty Acids/metabolism;;; Lipid Metabolism;;; *Sirtuins/metabolism", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Zang, Mengwei; Gao, Bin", "jour": "Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM", "affl": "Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies, Center for Healthy Aging, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA; Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, South Texas Veterans Health Care System, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.

METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with a diet high in fat content to produce NAFLD models. These models were then treated with overexpressed ISL1 (oe-ISL1), oe-Lysine-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B), oe-SNAI1, or short hairpin RNA against SNAI1. We assessed triglyceride and cholesterol contents in the plasma and liver tissues and determined the expressions of ISL1, KDM6B and SNAI1 in liver tissues. Moreover, the in vitro model of lipid accumulation was constructed using fatty acids to explore the in vitro effect of ISL1/KDM6B/SNAI1 in NAFLD. RESULTS: The results showed that the expressions of ISL1, KDM6B, and SNAI1 where decreased, but contents of triglyceride and cholesterol increased in mice exposed to high-fat diet. ISL1 inhibited lipogenesis and promoted lipolysis and exhibited a synergizing effect with KDM6B to upregulate the expression of SNAI1.

Importantly, the therapeutic effects of ISL1 on in vitro model of lipid accumulations was also confirmed through the modulation of KDM6B and SNAI1.

Nakai (IC) is a folk medicinal herb used in Mongolian medical clinics for the treatment of hepatitis and fatty liver diseases even though its pharmacological mechanism has not been well characterized. This study investigated the hepatoprotective mechanism of IC on mice with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by integrating gut microbiota and metabolomic analysis. A high-fat diet (HFD) was used to develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, after which the mice were treated with oral IC (0.5, 1.5 and 3.0 g/kg) for 10 weeks. HFD induced NAFLD and the therapeutic effects were characterized by pathological and histological evaluations, and the serum indicators were analyzed by ELISA. The gut microbial and metabolite profiles were studied by 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomic analysis, respectively. The results showed that the administration of IC resulted in significant decreases in body weight; liver index; serum biomarkers such as ALT, TG, and LDL-C; and the liver inflammatory factors IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. The 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that administration of IC extract altered both the composition and abundance of the gut microbiota. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of liver samples detected a total of 212 metabolites, of which 128 were differentially expressed between the HFD and IC group. IC was found to significantly alter the levels of metabolites such as L-glutamic acid, pyridoxal, ornithine, L-aspartic acid, D-proline, and N4-acetylaminobutanal, which are involved in the regulation of glutamine and glutamate, Vitamin B6 metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolic pathways. Correlation analysis indicated that the effects of the IC extract on metabolites were associated with alterations in the abundance of Akkermansiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Muribaculaceae.

Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) is a hepatotropic co-mitogen that was found to have anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties and to attenuate experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cholestasis. Additionally, hepatic ALR expression is diminished in patients with NAFLD or cholestasis, but less is known about the mechanisms of its regulation under these conditions. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of IL-1ss in ALR expression and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this regulation in vitro. We found that ALR promoter activity and mRNA and protein expression were reduced upon treatment with IL-1ss. Early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1), an ALR inducer, was induced by IL-1ss but could not activate ALR expression, which may be attributed to reduced Egr-1 binding to the ALR promoter. The expression and nuclear localization of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha), another ALR-inducing transcription factor, was reduced by IL-1ss. Interestingly, c-Jun, a potential regulator of ALR and HNF4alpha, showed increased nuclear phosphorylation levels upon IL-1ss treatment but did not change the expression of ALR or HNF4alpha. In conclusion, this study offers evidence regarding the regulation of anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative ALR by IL-1ss through reduced Egr-1 promoter binding and diminished HNF4alpha expression independent of c-Jun activation.

Health system and public health responses to NAFLD have been weak and fragmented, and, despite its pervasiveness, NAFLD is largely unknown outside hepatology and gastroenterology. There is only a nascent global public health movement addressing NAFLD, and the disease is absent from nearly all national and international strategies and policies for non-communicable diseases, including obesity.

This prospective cross-sectional study aimed to develop a scoring system for NASH diagnosis through multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and clinical indicators. METHODS: Medical history, laboratory tests, and MR parameters of patients with NAFLD were assessed. A scoring system was developed using a logistic regression model. In total, 127 patients (58 with nonalcoholic fatty liver [NAFL] and 69 with NASH) were enrolled. After evaluating 23 clinical characteristics of the patients (4 categorical and 19 numeric variables) for the NASH diagnostic model, an equation for MR elastography (MRE)-based NASH score was obtained using 3 demographic factors, 2 laboratory variables, and MRE. RESULTS: The MRE-based NASH score showed a satisfactory accuracy for NASH diagnosis (c-statistics, 0.841; 95% CI 0.772-0.910). At a cut-off MRE-based NASH score of 0.68 for NASH diagnosis, its sensitivity was 0.68 and specificity was 0.91. When an MRE-based NASH score of 0.37 was used as a cut-off for NASH exclusion, the sensitivity was 0.91 and specificity was 0.55. Overall, 35% (44/127) of patients were in the gray zone (between 0.37 and 0.68).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overall, 50776 staff from the Kailuan Group who participated in and finished physical examinations between 2006 and 2007 were included in the cohort study. Their medical information was collected and they were followed after examination. The correlations of waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) or serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-crp) with NAFLD were analyzed. Then, we categorized all participants into four groups: non-abdominal obesity and non-chronic inflammation group, abdominal obesity and non-chronic inflammation group, non-abdominal obesity and chronic inflammation group, abdominal obesity and chronic inflammation group, and non-abdominal obesity and non-chronic inflammation group was used as a control group. The combined effects of abdominal obesity and chronic inflammation with NAFLD were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 5.59+/-1.79 years, a total of 15451 NAFLD cases occurred. We found the WHtR and hs-crp increase the risk for NAFLD, respectively. Compared with the non-abdominal obesity and non-chronic inflammation group, the risk of NAFLD was significantly increased in the abdominal obesity and non-chronic inflammation group (HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.11-1.32), non-abdominal obesity and chronic inflammation group (HR 1.32, 95%CI 1.27-1.38), abdominal obesity and chronic inflammation group (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.52-1.70).

Although overweight and obesity status are thought to be an effective indicator for NAFLD screening, the exact prevalence of NAFLD in this population remains unknown. We aimed to report the prevalence of NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in the overweight and obese population. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Medline and Embase from database inception until March 6, 2022, using search terms including but not limited to \"non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\", \"overweight\", \"obesity\", and \"prevalence\". Cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies published after Jan 1, 2000, written in or translated into English were eligible for inclusion; paediatric studies were excluded. Articles were included if the number of NAFLD, NAFL, or NASH events in an overweight and obese population could be extracted. Summary data were extracted from published reports. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of NAFLD, NAFL, and NASH in an overweight and obese population and the prevalence of fibrosis in individuals who were overweight or obese and who had NAFLD. A meta-analysis of proportions was done with the generalised linear mixed model. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022344526). FINDINGS: The search identified 7389 articles. 151 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. In the pooled analysis comprising 101 028 individuals, the prevalence of NAFLD in the overweight population was 69.99% (95% CI 65.40-74.21 I(2)=99.10%), the prevalence of NAFL was 42.49% (32.55-53.08, I(2)=96.40%), and the prevalence of NASH was 33.50% (28.38-39.04, I(2)=95.60%). Similar prevalence estimates were reported in the obese population for NAFLD (75.27% [95% CI 70.90-79.18]; I(2)=98.50%), NAFL (43.05% [32.78-53.97]; I(2)=96.30%) and NASH (33.67% [28.45-39.31]; I(2)=95.60%). The prevalence of NAFLD in the overweight population was the highest in the region of the Americas (75.34% [95% CI: 67.31-81.93]; I(2)=99.00%). Clinically significant fibrosis (stages F2-4) was present in 20.27% (95% CI 11.32-33.62; I(2)= 93.00%) of overweight individuals with NAFLD and in 21.60% (11.47-36.92; I(2)=95.00%) of obese patients with NAFLD while 6.65% (4.35-10.01; I(2)=58.00%) of overweight individuals with NAFLD and 6.85% (3.85-11.90; I(2)=90.00%) of obese individuals with NAFLD had advanced fibrosis (stages F3-4).

NASH, a leading indication for liver transplantation, is growing in prevalence. The extent of liver fibrosis, ranging from fibrosis stage (FS) of none (F0) to cirrhosis (F4), is a strong predictor of health outcomes. There is little information on patient demographics and clinical characteristics by fibrosis stage and NASH treatment outside of academic medical centers. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using Ipsos' syndicated NASH Therapy Monitor database, consisting of medical chart audits provided by sampled NASH-treating physicians in the United States in 2016 (n = 174) and 2017 (n = 164). Data was collected online. RESULTS: Of 2,366 patients reported on by participating physicians and included in the analysis, 68% had FS F0-F2, 21% had bridging fibrosis (F3), and 9% had cirrhosis (F4). Common comorbidities were type 2 diabetes (56%), hyperlipidemia (44%), hypertension (46%), and obesity (42%). Patients with more advanced fibrosis scores (F3-F4) had higher comorbidity rates than patients with F0-F2. Commonly used diagnostic tests included ultrasound (80%), liver biopsy (78%), AST/ALT ratio (43%), NAFLD fibrosis score (25%), transient elastography (23%), NAFLD liver fat score (22%), and Fatty Liver Index (19%). Most commonly prescribed medications were vitamin E (53%), statins (51%), metformin (47%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (28%), and beta blockers (22%). Medications were commonly prescribed for reasons other than their known effects. CONCLUSION: Physicians in this study, drawn from a spectrum of practice settings, relied on ultrasound and liver biopsy for diagnosis and vitamin E, statins, and metformin for pharmacological treatment of NASH. These findings imply poor adherence to guidelines in the diagnosis and management of NAFLD and NASH. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease caused by excess fat in the liver which can lead to liver inflammation and scarring (fibrosis), ranging from stage F0 (no scarring) to F4 (advanced scarring). The stage of liver scarring can predict the likelihood of future health problems, including liver failure and liver cancer. However, we do not fully understand how patient characteristics may vary at different stages of liver scarring. We looked at medical information from physicians treating patients diagnosed with NASH to understand how patient characteristics might differ based on the severity of their liver scarring. The majority (68%) of patients were stage F0-F2, with 30% having advanced scarring (F3-F4). In addition to NASH, many patients also had type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and obesity. Patients with more advanced scarring (F3-F4) were more likely to have these diseases than patients with less severe disease (F0-F2). Diagnosis of NASH by participating physicians was based on tests including imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI), liver biopsy, blood tests, and whether patients had other conditions that would put them at risk for NASH. The medications that the doctors prescribed most often to their patients included vitamin E and drugs to treat high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Medications were frequently prescribed for reasons other than their known effects.

This study aimed to examine the association between the Energy-adjusted Diet Inflammatory Index (E-DII) score and severe NAFLD using UK Biobank. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 171,544 UK Biobank participants. The E-DII score was computed using 18 food parameters. Associations between the E-DII and incident severe NAFLD (defined as hospital admission or death) were first investigated by E-DII categories (very/moderately anti-inflammatory [E-DII <  - 1], neutral [E-DII - 1 to 1] and very/moderately pro-inflammatory [E-DII > 1]) using Cox proportional hazard models. Nonlinear associations were investigated using penalised cubic splines fitted into the Cox proportional hazard models. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related factors. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 10.2 years, 1489 participants developed severe NAFLD. After adjusting for confounders, individuals in the very/moderately pro-inflammatory category had a higher risk (HR: 1.19 [95% CI: 1.03 to 1.38]) of incident severe NAFLD compared with those in the very/moderately anti-inflammatory category. There was some evidence of nonlinearity between the E-DII score and severe NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-inflammatory diets were associated with a higher risk of severe NAFLD independent of confounders such as the components of the metabolic syndrome.

METHODS: We included participants from 2 independent cohorts, they Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) and UK Biobank (UKBB), who had NAFLD defined by elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the absence of alternative chronic liver disease. The primary predictors were genetic variants and metabolic comorbidities associated with cirrhosis. We conducted time-to-event analyses using Fine-Gray competing risk models. RESULTS: We included 7893 and 46,880 participants from MGI and UKBB, respectively. In univariable analysis, PNPLA3-rs738409-GG genotype, diabetes, obesity, and ALT of >/=2x upper limit of normal were associated with higher incidence rate of cirrhosis in both MGI and UKBB. PNPLA3-rs738409-GG had additive effects with clinical risk factors including diabetes, obesity, and ALT elevations. Among patients with indeterminate fibrosis-4 (FIB4) scores (1.3-2.67), those with diabetes and PNPLA3-rs738409-GG genotype had an incidence rate of cirrhosis comparable to that of patients with high-risk FIB4 scores (>2.67) and 2.9-4.8 times that of patients with diabetes but CC/CG genotypes.

As NAFLD is affecting 10-24% of the general population and approximately 70% of obese patients, it carries a large economic burden and is becoming a major reason for liver transplantation worldwide. ALD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality causing 50% of liver cirrhosis and 10% of liver cancer related death. Increasing evidence has accumulated that gut-derived factors play a crucial role in the development and progression of chronic liver diseases. METHODS: A selective literature search was conducted in Medline and PubMed, using the terms \"nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,\" \"alcoholic liver disease,\" \"lipopolysaccharide,\" \"gut barrier,\" and \"microbiome.\" RESULTS: Gut dysbiosis and gut barrier dysfunction both contribute to chronic liver disease by abnormal regulation of the gut-liver axis. Thereby, gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are a key factor in inducing the inflammatory response of liver tissue. The review further underlines that endotoxemia is observed in both NAFLD and ALD patients. LPS plays an important role in conducting liver damage through the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway. Treatments targeting the gut microbiome and the gut barrier such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) represent potential treatment modalities for NAFLD and ALD. CONCLUSIONS: The gut-liver axis plays an important role in the development of liver disease.

METHODS: We included participants from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study (Finnish sample) and KORA study (German sample) who underwent abdominal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, respectively, for detection of FLD and had serum analyses available for calculation of Fatty Liver Index (FLI), Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI), Lipid Accumulation Product (LAP), and Dallas Steatosis Index (DSI).

Here, we provide evidence regarding the relationship between the polarization shift in Kupffer cells and autophagy resulting from lipid exposure. High-fat and high-fructose diet supplementation for 10 weeks significantly increased the abundance of Kupffer cells with an M1-predominant phenotype in mice. Interestingly, at the molecular level, we also observed a concomitant increase in expression of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and reduced autophagy in the NAFLD mice. We also observed hypermethylation at the promotor regions of autophagy genes (LC3B, ATG-5, and ATG-7). Furthermore, the pharmacological inhibition of DNMT1 by using DNA hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and zebularine) restored Kupffer cell autophagy, M1/M2 polarization, and therefore prevented the progression of NAFLD.

To achieve this, lifestyle interventions including daily exercise and diet must be encouraged. We aimed to assess the effects of diet, exercise, or a combination of both compared to conventional treatment in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS AND FINDING: A literature search was performed in CENTRAL, EMBASE, and PubMed. Randomized controlled trials comparing lifestyle changes with conventional treatment were included, without date restriction. Two authors searched studies according to eligibility criteria, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Subgroup analysis was made by type of intervention, duration of intervention and supervision. We calculated mean differences between the intervention and the control group with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

Thus far, exercise appears to be an effective treatment approach. However, its effects cannot last long and, moreover, it is difficult to achieve for many obese people. Thus, it is necessary to look into alternative remedies. The present study explored a noninvasive, easy, tolerable physical alternative. In our experiment, C57BL/6 mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce overweight/obesity and were exposed to 10% oxygen for one hour every day. We found that hypoxia exerted protective effects. First, it offset HFD-induced bodyweight gain and insulin resistance. Secondly, hypoxia reversed the HFD-induced enlargement of white and brown adipocytes and fatty liver, and protected liver function. Thirdly, HFD downregulated the expression of genes required for lipolysis and thermogenesis, such as UCP1, ADR3(beta3-adrenergic receptor), CPT1A, ATGL, PPARalpha, and PGC1alpha, M2 macrophage markers arginase and CD206 in the liver, and UCP1 and PPARgamma in brown fat, while these molecules were upregulated by hypoxia. Furthermore, hypoxia induced the activation of AMPK, an energy sensing enzyme. Fourthly, our results showed that hypoxia increased serum levels of epinephrine. Indeed, the effects of hypoxia on bodyweight, fatty liver, and associated changes in gene expression ever tested were reproduced by injection of epinephrine and prevented by propranolol at varying degrees. Altogether, our data suggest that hypoxia triggers stress responses where epinephrine plays important roles.

FIB-4 index is considered a useful marker for evaluating liver fibrosis but the distribution of FIB-4 index in the general population remains unknown. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included residents who underwent ultrasonography at health checkups in Hiroshima or Iwate prefectures. The distribution of FIB-4 index in the total study population (N = 75,666) as well as in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) populations (N = 17,968) and non-drinkers without fatty liver populations (N = 47,222) was evaluated. The distribution of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels was also evaluated. RESULTS: The mean FIB-4 index in the total study population was 1.20 +/- 0.63. FIB-4 index >/= 2.67, which indicates a high risk of liver fibrosis, was found in 16.4% of those aged >/= 70 years. In the NAFLD population, 58.1% of those in their 60 s and 88.1% of those >/= 70 years met the criteria for referral to hepatologists by using the recommended FIB-4 index cutoff value (>/= 1.3). The mean FIB-4 index in the NAFLD population (1.12 +/- 0.58) was significantly lower than in the non-drinkers without fatty liver (1.23 +/- 0.63, p < 0.0001). The non-drinkers without fatty liver tended to have higher AST relative to ALT levels (60.0% with AST/ALT > 1.0), whereas the results in the NAFLD population were opposite (14.8% with AST/ALT > 1.0). AST > ALT resulted in a higher FIB-4 index in non-drinkers without fatty liver due to the nature of FIB-4 index formula. CONCLUSIONS: The cutoff value of FIB-4 index (>/= 1.3) for triaging the elderly people with fatty liver for referral to hepatologists should be reconsidered to avoid over-referral. Due to the impact of age and characteristics of AST/ALT ratios, there is no prospect of using FIB-4 index for primary screening for liver fibrosis in a general population of unknown presence or absence of liver disease, even though it can be easily calculated using routine clinical indices.

However, it is not only the level but also the distribution of body fat that contributes to increased disease risks. For example, an increased level of abdominal fat, or visceral adipose tissue (VAT), is associated with a higher risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). METHODS: A review of the most relevant primary and secondary sources on body composition from the last 25 years was conducted. Relevant articles were identified using PUBMED and Google Scholar. Narrative synthesis was performed as statistical pooling was not possible due to the heterogeneous nature of the studies. RESULTS: The body mass index (BMI) is commonly used as a proxy measure of body fatness. However, BMI does not reflect the level and distribution of body fat. Other anthropometric methods such as waist circumference measurement and waist-hip ratio, as well as methodologies like hydro densitometry, bioelectrical impedance, and isotope dilution are also limited in their ability to determine body fat distribution. Imaging techniques to define body composition have greatly improved performance over traditional approaches. Ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are now commonly used in clinical research. Of these, MRI can provide the most accurate and high-resolution measure of body composition. In addition, MRI techniques are considered the best for the determination of fat at the organ level. On the other hand, imaging modalities require specialized, often expensive equipment and expert operation. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropometric methods are suitable for rapid, high-volume screening of subjects but do not provide information on body fat distribution. Imaging techniques are more accurate but are expensive and do not lend themselves for high throughput. Therefore, successful trial strategies require a tiered approach in which subjects are first screened using anthropometric methods followed by more sophisticated modalities during the execution of the trial.

We aimed to predict the burden of NAFLD by examining and estimating the temporal trends of its worldwide prevalence and incidence. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science without language restrictions for reports published between date of database inception and May 25, 2021. We included observational cross-sectional or longitudinal studies done in study populations representative of the general adult population, in whom NAFLD was diagnosed using an imaging method in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption and viral hepatitis. Studies were excluded if conducted in paediatric populations (aged <18 years) or subgroups of the general population. Summary estimates were extracted from included reports by KR and independently verified by HA using the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes framework. Primary outcomes were the prevalence and incidence of NAFLD. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate overall and sex-specific pooled effect estimates and 95% CIs. FINDINGS: The search identified 28 557 records, of which 13 577 records were screened; 299 records were also identified via other methods. In total, 72 publications with a sample population of 1 030 160 individuals from 17 countries were included in the prevalence analysis, and 16 publications with a sample population of 381 765 individuals from five countries were included in the incidence analysis. The overall prevalence of NAFLD worldwide was estimated to be 32.4% (95% CI 29.9-34.9). Prevalence increased significantly over time, from 25.5% (20.1-31.0) in or before 2005 to 37.8% (32.4-43.3) in 2016 or later (p=0.013). Overall prevalence of NAFLD was significantly higher in men than in women (39.7% [36.6-42.8] vs 25.6% [22.3-28.8]; p<0.0001). The overall incidence of NAFLD was estimated to be 46.9 cases per 1000 person-years (36.4-57.5); 70.8 cases per 1000 person-years (48.7-92.8) in men and 29.6 cases per 1000 person-years (20.2-38.9) in women (p<0.0001). There was considerable heterogeneity between studies of both NAFLD prevalence (I(2)=99.9%) and NAFLD incidence (I(2)=99.9%). INTERPRETATION: Worldwide prevalence of NAFLD is considerably higher than previously estimated and is continuing to increase at an alarming rate. Incidence and prevalence of NAFLD are significantly higher among men than among women. Greater awareness of NAFLD and the development of cost-effective risk stratification strategies are warranted to address the growing burden of NAFLD.

Moreover, life expectancy in NAFLD has not been studied. We therefore examined CVD risk and life expectancy in patients with NAFLD compared with the general population. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this nationwide population-based cohort, all patients with NAFLD diagnosis and without baseline CVD (ascertaining from the Swedish National Patient Register from 1987 to 2016, n = 10,023) were matched 10:1 on age, sex, and municipality to individuals from the general population (controls, n = 96,313). CVD diagnosis and mortality were derived from national registers. Multistate models and flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for CVD risk and loss in life expectancy due to NAFLD. We identified 1037 (10.3%) CVD events in patients with NAFLD and 4041 (4.2%) in controls. CVD risk was 2.6-fold higher in NAFLD compared with controls (aHR = 2.61, 95% CI = 2.36-2.88) and was strongest for nonfatal CVD (aHR = 3.71, 95% CI = 3.29-4.17). After a nonfatal CVD event, the risk for all-cause mortality was similar between patients with NAFLD and controls (aHR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.64-1.25).

Additionally, BAFF deficiency reduced the number of CD11c(+) M1-type macrophages in the liver. Moreover, BAFF stimulated RAW264.7 cells to secrete nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which drove the activation of hepatic stellate cells.

C57Bl/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or normal-fat diet (NFD) with matching calories for 6 weeks. An 8-week methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet was used to induce fibrosis. Two weeks following diet treatment, mice were implanted with a subcutaneous osmotic pump delivering either the peptide PRR antagonist, PRO20, or scrambled peptide for 4 or 6 weeks. Mice fed a 6-week HFD exhibited increased liver lipid accumulation and liver triglyceride content compared with NFD-fed mice. Importantly, PRO20 treatment reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD-fed mice without affecting body weight or blood glucose. Furthermore, PRR antagonism attenuated HFD-induced steatosis, particularly microvesicular steatosis. In the MCD diet model, the percentage of collagen area was reduced in PRO20-treated compared with control mice. PRO20 treatment also significantly decreased levels of liver alanine aminotransferase, an indicator of liver damage, in MCD-fed mice compared with controls. Mechanistically, we found that PRR antagonism prevented HFD-induced increases in PPARgamma and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3 expression in the liver.

It is more common in those living with obesity, where it may affect as many as 80% of individuals. The aim of this article is to describe recent human studies evaluating the influence of omega-3 fatty acids on de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and hepatic fatty acid partitioning between incorporation into triacylglycerols (TAGs) and beta-oxidation, to discuss the relevance of these effects in the context of NAFLD, and to provide an overview of the mechanisms that might be involved. RECENT FINDINGS: The omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) decrease hepatic DNL and partition fatty acids away from TAG synthesis and toward beta-oxidation. EPA and DHA affect multiple hepatic transcription factors resulting in down-regulation of the DNL pathway and upregulation of beta-oxidation. The net result is decreased accumulation of hepatic TAG and lowering of circulating TAG concentrations. Human trials demonstrate that EPA and DHA can decrease liver fat in patients with NAFLD.

We examined whether there is an association between lower plasma adiponectin levels and the presence/severity of NAFLD in people with T2DM. METHODS: We cross-sectionally recruited 79 men with non-insulin-treated T2DM and no known liver diseases, who had consecutively attended our diabetes outpatient service over a 6-month period and who underwent both ultrasonography and Fibroscan-measured liver stiffness (LSM). Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (PNPLA3 rs738409 and other genetic variants) associated with NAFLD were investigated. RESULTS: Among the 79 participants included (mean age 67 +/- 10 years, BMI 27.7 +/- 4 kg/m(2)), 28 did not have NAFLD, 32 had steatosis alone, and 19 had NAFLD with coexisting significant fibrosis (LSM >/= 7.0 kPa by Fibroscan(R)). Compared to those without NAFLD, patients with hepatic steatosis alone and those with hepatic steatosis and coexisting significant fibrosis had lower high-molecular-weight adiponectin levels (5.5 [IQR 2.3-7.6] vs. 2.4 [1.8-3.7] vs. 1.6 [1.0-2.9] microg/mL; p < 0.001). After adjustment for age, body mass index, insulin resistance, and the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant, lower plasma adiponectin levels were found to be associated with increased odds of both steatosis alone (adjusted-odds ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% CI 1.04-5.56, p = 0.042) and NAFLD with coexisting significant fibrosis (adjusted-OR 3.84, 95% CI 1.23-10.0, p = 0.020). Similar findings were observed after adjustment for the other eight genotyped NAFLD-related polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: Lower plasma adiponectin levels are closely associated with the presence and severity of NAFLD in men with T2DM, pointing to a role of adiponectin in NAFLD development and progression.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35831700/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1007/s42000-022-00387-6 https://sci-hub.do/387 https://sci-hub.do/10.1007/s42000-022-00387-6", "pt": "Journal Article; Observational Study", "pl": "Switzerland"}, {"uid": 37387077, "aid": "SHTI230543 10.3233/SHTI230543", "titl": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Diagnosis with Multi-Group Factors.", "mesh": "Humans;;; Cohort Studies;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnosis;;; Benchmarking;;; Health Status;;; Laboratories", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Arzehgar, Afrooz; Nezhad Noor Nia, Raheleh Ghouchan; Dehdeleh, Vajiheh; Roudi, Fatemeh; Eslami, Saeid", "jour": "Studies in health technology and informatics", "affl": "Department of Medical Informatics, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.;;; Department of Medical Informatics, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.;;; Department of Medical Informatics, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.;;; Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.;;; Department of Medical Informatics, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.", "pdat": "2023 Jun 29", "tiab": "Although various clinical factors affect the diagnosis of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), most studies only use single-source data such as images or laboratory data.

It affects 20% of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Due to liver dysfunction and the numerous metabolic changes that commonly accompany the condition (obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome), the secretion of organokines is modified, which may contribute to the pathogenesis or progression of the disease. In this sense, this study aimed to perform a review of the role of organokines in NASH. Thus, by combining descriptors such as NASH, organokines, oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, a search was carried out in the EMBASE, MEDLINE-PubMed, and Cochrane databases of articles published in the last ten years. Insulin resistance, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, fructose, and intestinal microbiota were factors identified as participating in the genesis and progression of NASH. Changes in the pattern of organokines secretion (adipokines, myokines, hepatokines, and osteokines) directly or indirectly contribute to aggravating the condition or compromise homeostasis.

As a result, this condition has recently become one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, the incidence of NAFLD-associated HCC (NAFLD-HCC) is expected to increase in the near future. Advanced liver fibrosis is the most common risk factor for NAFLD-HCC. However, up to 50% of NAFLD-HCC cases develop without underlying liver cirrhosis. Epidemiological studies have revealed many other risk factors for this condition; including diabetes, other metabolic traits, obesity, old age, male sex, Hispanic ethnicity, mild alcohol intake, and elevated liver enzymes. Specific gene variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms of patatin-like phospholipase domain 3, transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2, and membrane-bound O-acyl-transferase domain-containing 7, are also associated with an increased risk of HCC in patients with NAFLD. This clinical and genetic information should be interpreted together for accurate risk prediction. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the only biomarker currently recommended for HCC screening. However, it is not sufficiently sensitive in addressing this diagnostic challenge. The GALAD score can be calculated based on sex, age, lectin-bound AFP, AFP, and des-carboxyprothrombin and is reported to show better diagnostic performance for HCC. In addition, emerging studies on genetic and epigenetic biomarkers have also yielded promising diagnostic potential.

We aimed to develop a novel treatment strategy to induce the expression of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), which is an important enzyme regulating S-adenosylmethionine metabolism whose expression is downregulated in patients with NAFLD. Because 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) is a GNMT inducer, and metformin was shown to upregulate liver mitochondrial GNMT protein expression, the effect of PGG and metformin was evaluated. Biochemical analysis, histopathological examination, immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blotting (WB), proteomic analysis and Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test were performed. The high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice were treated with PGG and metformin. Combination of PGG and metformin nearly completely reversed weight gain, elevation of serum aminotransferases, and hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis. In addition, the downregulated GNMT expression in liver tissues of HFD-induced NAFLD mice was restored. The GNMT expression was further confirmed by RT-qPCR and WB analysis using both in vitro and in vivo systems.

Patterns, diagnoses, timing and predictors of 30-day readmissions for CLD from 2010-2017 were assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) is an all-payer, all-ages, longitudinal administrative database, representing 35 million discharges in the US population yearly. We identified unique patients discharged with CLD including hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV), alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from 2010 through 2017. Survey-weight adjusted multivariable analyses were used. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2017, the 30-day readmission rate for CLD decreased from 18.4% to 17.8% (p=.008), while increasing for NAFLD from 17.0% to 19. 9% (p<.001). Of 125,019 patients discharged with CLD (mean age 57.4 years, male 59.0%) in 2017, the most common liver disease was HCV (29.2%), followed by ALD (23.5%), NAFLD (17.5%), and HBV (4.3%). Readmission rates were 20.5% for ALD, 19.9% for NAFLD, 16.8% for HCV and 16.7% for HBV. Compared to other liver diseases, patients with NAFLD had significantly higher risk of 30-day readmission in clinical comorbidities adjusted model (Hazard ratio [HR]=1.08 [95% confidence interval 1.03-1.13]). In addition to ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, higher number of coexisting comorbidities, comorbidities associated with higher risk of 30-day readmission included cirrhosis for NALFD and HCV; acute kidney injury for NAFLD, HCV and ALD; HCC for HCV, and peritonitis for ALD. Cirrhosis and cirrhosis-related complications were the most common reasons for 30-day readmission, followed by sepsis. However, a large proportion of patients (43.7% for NAFLD; 28.4% for HCV, 39.0% for HBV, and 29.1% for ALD) were readmitted for extrahepatic reasons. Approximately 20% of those discharged with CLD were readmitted within 30 days but the majority of readmissions occurred within 15 days of discharge (62.8% for NAFLD, 63.7% for HCV, 74.3% for HBV, and 72.9% for ALD). Among readmitted patients, patients with NAFLD or HCV readmitted </=30-day had significantly higher costs and risk of in-hospital mortality (NAFLD +5.69% change [95% confidence interval, 2.54%-8.93%] and odds ratio (OR)=1.58 [1.28-1.95]; HCV +9.85% change [95%CI:6.96%-12.82%] and OR=1.31, 1.08-1.59). CONCLUSIONS: Early readmissions for CLD are prevalent causing economic and clinical burden to the US healthcare system, especially NAFLD readmissions.

Regarding the role of gut-liver axis in liver disease development, this study aimed to explore the potential role of gut microbiota in the treatment of OCA in NAFLD mice induced by the high-fat diet (HFD). Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion (AIMD) and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) confirmed the critical role of gut microbiota in OCA treatment for NAFLD by effectively alleviating histopathological lesions and restoring liver function impaired by HFD. Metagenomic analysis indicated that OCA intervention in HFD mice remarkably increased the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Alistipes spp., Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus thermophilus, and Parasutterella excrementihominis. Targeted metabolomics analysis indicated that OCA could modulate host bile acids pool by reducing levels of serum hydrophobic cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and increasing levels of serum-conjugated bile acids, such as taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and tauroursodesoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in the HFD-fed mice. Strong correlations were observed between differentially abundant microbes and the shifted bile acids. Furthermore, bacteria enriched by OCA intervention exhibited much greater potential in encoding 7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7alpha-HSDs) producing secondary bile acids rather than bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) mainly responsible for primary bile acid deconjugation.

The excess mortality in NAFLD patients is strongly related to extrahepatic comorbidities. Recently, an association between NAFLD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been reported in various populations. METHODS: Based on the IQVIA Disease Analyzer database, this retrospective study examined two cohorts from Germany matched for sex, age, index year, annual visit frequency, hypertension, and diabetes, including 92,225 patients with and without NAFLD. The incidence of CKD was assessed as a function of NAFLD using Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 92,225 NAFLD patients as well as 92,225 patients without NAFLD were included into analyses. CKD was diagnosed in 19.1% vs. 11.1% of patients with and without NAFLD within the 10 years observation period (p < 0.001). Cox regression confirmed a significant association between NAFLD and CKD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.80 (95%CI: 1.73-1.86, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that this association was most pronounced in the age group of 18 to 50 years (HR: 2.13, 95%CI: 1.91-2.37, p < 0.001) and among female NAFLD patients (HR 1.85, 95%CI: 1.76-1.95, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm a significantly increased risk of developing CKD in a large, real-world cohort of adult NAFLD patients in Germany.

Using a survey-weighted analysis, a total of 25.43%, 6.95%, and 0.73% of the population were classified as nonalcoholic steatotic liver disease, alcohol-associated steatotic liver disease, and viral hepatitis steatotic liver disease, respectively. A sensitivity analysis at controlled attenuation parameter of 248 dB/m and fatty liver index found similar distribution. In a comparison between nonalcoholic steatotic liver disease, alcohol-associated steatotic liver disease, and viral hepatitis steatotic liver disease, there was no significant difference between the odds of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis between groups. However, viral hepatitis steatotic liver disease individuals were found to have a significantly higher odds of clinically significant fibrosis (OR: 3.76, 95% CI, 1.27-11.14, p =0.02) compared with nonalcoholic steatotic liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis assessed the proposed changes based on discussions from the consensus meeting.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of bromelain on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-induced deregulation of blood coagulation and the underlying molecular mechanisms. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), with or without bromelain (20 mg/kg/day) administration, for 12 weeks. Treatment with bromelain decreased thrombus formation in the liver and prolonged HFD-induced shortened prothrombin, activated partial thromboplastin, and fibrinogen times. Moreover, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis showed that bromelain inhibited NAFLD-induced activation of the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways by upregulating the protein expression of antithrombin III, serpin family G member 1, and alpha1-antitrypsin, and downregulating the protein expression of fibrinogen in the liver and plasma. Bromelain also upregulated the level of plasminogen and downregulating factor XIII expression in the liver and plasma. Collectively, these findings suggest that bromelain exerts anticoagulant effects on NAFLD-induced deregulation of coagulation by inhibiting the activation of the coagulation cascade, decreasing the stability of clots, and promoting fibrinolytic activity.

METHODS: We searched medical literature using Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and ProQuest, from inception to September 30, 2021. We included observational studies reporting the prevalence of NAFLD in >/=50 adult patients with IBD. Diagnosis of NAFLD could be based on imaging, histopathology, and/or hepatic steatosis index. Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, prior surgery (bowel resection), corticosteroids, biologics and immunomodulators were assessed as potential risk factors for NAFLD. RESULTS: Of 1893 citations, 44 eligible studies were finally included, comprising 14 947 subjects from 18 different countries. Pooled prevalence of NAFLD was 30.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26.5-34.9) in patients with IBD worldwide, which varied regionally. No significant difference was observed in the odds ratio (OR) of NAFLD among Crohn's disease (CD) patients compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (1.16, 95% CI 0.93-1.44). Risk of NAFLD was almost twice as high in patients with IBD as in healthy subjects (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.13-3.41). Age (adjusted OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05) and BMI (adjusted OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.22-1.32) were statistically significantly associated with increased risk of NAFLD. The pooled prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis in IBD patients with NAFLD was 13.6% (95% CI 7.6-19.7) based on six studies.

However, there have been inconsistent reports on the association between fatty liver disease and atrial fibrillation, while the role of liver stiffness in this association remains unclear. METHODS: Within the Rotterdam Study, a large prospective ongoing cohort, participants attending the abdominal ultrasound program between 2009-2014 were included. Exclusion criteria were no atrial fibrillation data or >20% missing data across analysis variables. Steatosis was assessed by ultrasound, liver stiffness by transient elastography and atrial fibrillation by 12-lead electrocardiograms. Incident atrial fibrillation was based on medical records and complete until 2014. Logistic and Cox-regression were used to quantify associations between fatty liver disease and atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: We included 5,825 participants (aged 69.5+/-9.1, 42.9% male), 35.7% had steatosis, liver stiffness measurement was available in 73.3%, and 7.0% had prevalent atrial fibrillation. Steatosis was not associated with prevalent atrial fibrillation in fully adjusted models (odds ratio [OR] 0.80; 95% CI 0.62-1.03), findings were consistent for non-alcoholic or metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease. Liver stiffness was significantly associated with prevalent atrial fibrillation (OR 1.09 per kPa, 95% CI 1.03-1.16); however, this was only persistent among those without steatosis (OR 1.18 per kPa, 95% CI 1.08-1.29). Lastly, no associations were found between steatosis (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.59-1.33; follow-up 2.1 [1.1-3.2] years) and incident atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty liver disease was not associated with prevalent or incident atrial fibrillation, while liver stiffness was significantly associated with atrial fibrillation, especially among those without steatosis. This association might be driven by venous congestion instead of fibrogenesis, but this awaits further validation. We recommend assessing cardiovascular health in participants with high liver stiffness, especially in the absence of overt liver disease. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NTR6831. LAY SUMMARY: There have been inconsistent reports about the potential links between fatty liver disease and atrial fibrillation (an irregular and often very fast heart rhythm). Herein, we show that liver stiffness (which is a marker of liver fibrosis), but not fatty liver disease, was associated with a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation.

Multiple parallel hits hypothesis has been suggested as progress of NAFLD, but the mechanism of NAFLD is not completely understood. beta-Tubulin is essential in mitoses, neuronal migration, and axon guidance during neuronal development. Pathogenic variants in the TUBB3 gene were shown to be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological abnormalities, but not accompanied by hepatic complications, such as NAFLD. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to examine the association between TUBB3 mutation and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). METHODS: An 11-year-old girl has been followed up as having atypical Mobius syndrome since infancy, as she was born with bilateral ptosis, paralytic strabismus, and facial weakness. At age 7 years, she was diagnosed with TUBB3 E410K syndrome by whole-exome sequencing. At age 10 years, her blood examination revealed elevated liver transaminase levels, which persisted for almost 2 years. She underwent liver biopsy, the results of which were suggestive of NASH. RESULTS: The expression of TUBB3 was absent, but that of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was present in the parenchymal nerve fibers of the liver.

Recently, the prevalence of NAFLD has dramatically increased, and treatment is urgently needed. Animal models are often used to understand the molecular mechanisms of disease development and progression, but their relevance to human diseases has not been fully understood. This study aimed to establish the usefulness of the animal model for preclinical research, we evaluated its relevance to human disease by gene expression analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis of liver tissues from a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet-induced NAFLD animal model. In addition, module preservation analysis was conducted to evaluate similarity across species. RESULTS: Several modules were identified to be associated with disease severity, and their gene co-expression network was found to be preserved in the human NAFLD datasets. Of note, module brown (immune cell clusters involved in inflammatory responses) was positively associated with disease severity, and its gene co-expression network was highly preserved in the human datasets. Tyrobp, Laptm5 and Lgals3 were identified as hub genes in the brown module, and their increased expression was confirmed in the human datasets.

AIM: To study correlation between CIMT and NAFLD and its association with increase in grades of NAFLD. Material and Study Design: An observational case control study of 40 cases and 40 controls (age and sex matched) was done. The difference of CIMT between the two groups was analysed. CIMT was also measured among the various grades of NAFLD cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 40 cases with NAFLD and 40 controls falling within the age group of 18-45 years were taken in the study. Patients with history of significant alcohol consumption, acute or chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, malignancy, hypothyroidism and having dyslipidaemia, CAD and stroke were excluded from the study. All the subjects underwent abdominal and carotid ultrasound in order to assess NAFLD and CIMT measurement. The left and right common carotid artery was examined using PHILIPS HD11XE high-definition ultrasound system equipped with a 3-12 MHz linear array transducer in B mode. OBSERVATION AND RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of CIMT with a p value of &lt;0.001. The mean CIMT in the Case group was 0.86 mm while in Control group was 0.52 mm. There was a significant difference between the 3 Grades of NAFLD in terms of CIMT with a p value of &lt;0.001 with maximum CIMT being in Grade 3 of NAFLD. Body Mass Index, Alanine Transaminase, Aspartate Transaminase, Alkaline Phosphatase, Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Low Density Lipoprotein were also found to have statistical significant difference between cases and controls. Age, gender, Blood pressure, Fasting Blood Sugar, HbA1c, Hemoglobin, Total leucocyte Count, Platelet count, Serum Bilirubin, Total protein and Albumin were found to be statistically insignificantly different between cases and controls.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex and involves the crosstalk between the liver and the white adipose tissue (WAT). Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) has been shown to control tissue lipid accumulation by regulating the transport properties of the vasculature. The role of VEGF-B signaling and the contribution to hepatic steatosis and NAFLD in T2DM is currently not understood. METHODS: C57BL/6 J mice treated with a neutralizing antibody against VEGF-B, or mice with adipocyte-specific overexpression or under-expression of VEGF-B (Adipoq(Cre+)/VEGF-B(TG/+) mice and Adipoq(Cre+)/Vegfb(fl/+)mice) were subjected to a 6-month high-fat diet (HFD), or chow-diet, whereafter NAFLD development was assessed. VEGF-B expression was analysed in WAT biopsies from patients with obesity and NAFLD in a pre-existing clinical cohort (n = 24 patients with NAFLD and n = 24 without NAFLD) and correlated to clinicopathological features. RESULTS: Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF-B signaling in diabetic mice reduced hepatic steatosis and NAFLD by blocking WAT lipolysis. Mechanistically we show, by using HFD-fed Adipoq(Cre+)/VEGF-B(TG/+) mice and HFD-fed Adipoq(Cre+)/Vegfb(fl/+)mice, that inhibition of VEGF-B signaling targets lipolysis in adipocytes. Reducing VEGF-B signaling ameliorated NAFLD by decreasing WAT inflammation, resolving WAT insulin resistance, and lowering the activity of the hormone sensitive lipase. Analyses of human WAT biopsies from individuals with NAFLD provided evidence supporting the contribution of VEGF-B signaling to NAFLD development. VEGF-B expression levels in adipocytes from two WAT depots correlated with development of dysfunctional WAT and NAFLD in humans. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data from mouse models and humans suggest that VEGF-B antagonism may represent an approach to combat NAFLD by targeting hepatic steatosis through suppression of lipolysis. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common comorbidity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and has a global prevalence of between 25-29%. There are currently no approved drugs for NAFLD, and given the scale of the ongoing diabetes epidemics, there is an urgent need to identify new treatment options. Our work suggests that VEGF-B antagonism may represent an approach to combat NAFLD by targeting hepatic steatosis through suppression of lipolysis. The neutralizing anti-VEGF-B antibody, which was used in this study, has already entered clinical trials for patients with diabetes.

Here, we revealed a novel mechanism by which OCA improves NAFLD by affecting hepatic long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) uptake. METHODS: Stably transfected HEK-293 cells expressing fatty acid transport protein 5 (FATP5) were established to examine fatty acid uptake; FXR(-/-), human (h) FATP5, and FXR(-/-)/hFATP5 mouse models were incorporated to explore the effects of OCA on FATP5 ex vivo and in vivo. RESULTS: OCA inhibited hFATP5 (IC(50) =0.07 muM) more than murine (m) FATP5 (IC(50) =1.04 muM) as measured by LCFAs uptake in FATP5 expressing HEK-293. OCA also inhibited LCFA uptake in primary hepatocytes from hFATP5 mice, FXR(-/-)/hFATP5 mice more than that from FXR(-/-) mice, ex vivo. Moreover, OCA inhibited LCFAs uptake by livers in hFATP5 mice and FXR(-/-)/hFATP5 mice, but not in FXR(-/-) mice, in vivo. Long-term administration of 0.04% OCA markedly reduced hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation in hFATP5 mice and FXR(-/-)/hFATP5 mice by 63% and 53%, respectively, but not in FXR(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: OCA ameliorated high-fat diet-induced NAFLD independent of FXR by inhibiting hepatic hFATP5-mediated LCFAs uptake.

Recently, NASH has been suggested to be a relevant driver in progressive liver cirrhosis and a population-attributable factor in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Moreover, predictions show that NAFLD-related annual health costs in the USA have reached  approximately $100 bi., but effective therapies are still scarce. Thus, new preventative strategies for this hepatic disease urgently need to be developed.

And the gut-liver axis theory supports the therapeutic role of intestinal flora in the development and progression of NAFLD. To this end, we designed bioinformatics study on the relationship between intestinal flora disorder and NAFLD, to explore the possible molecular mechanism of intestinal flora interfering with NAFLD. METHODS: Differentially expressed genes for NAFLD were obtained from the GEO database. And the disease genes for NAFLD and intestinal flora disorder were obtained from the disease databases. The protein-protein interaction network was established by string 11.0 database and visualized by Cytoscape 3.7.2 software. Cytoscape plug-in MCODE and cytoHubba were used to screen the potential genes of intestinal flora disorder and NAFLD, to obtain potential targets for intestinal flora to interfere in the occurrence and process of NAFLD. Enrichment analysis of potential targets was carried out using R 4.0.2 software. RESULTS: The results showed that 7 targets might be the key genes for intestinal flora to interfere with NAFLD. CCL2, IL6, IL1B, and FOS are mainly related to the occurrence and development mechanism of NAFLD, while PTGS2, SPINK1, and C5AR1 are mainly related to the intervention of intestinal flora in the occurrence and development of NAFLD. The gene function is mainly reflected in basic biological processes, including the regulation of metabolic process, epithelial development, and immune influence. The pathway is mainly related to signal transduction, immune regulation, and physiological metabolism. The TNF signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic activity, and NF-Kappa B signaling pathways are important pathways for intestinal flora to interfere with NAFLD. According to the analysis results, there is a certain correlation between intestinal flora disorder and NAFLD. CONCLUSION: It is speculated that the mechanism by which intestinal flora may interfere with the occurrence and development of NAFLD is mainly related to inflammatory response and insulin resistance.

The pathogenesis of TM6SF2-efficient NAFLD remains unclear, resulting in a lack of therapeutic strategies for TM6SF2-deficient patients. AIM: To investigate the role of TM6SF2 in fatty acid metabolism in the context of fatty liver and propose possible therapeutic strategies for NAFLD caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. METHODS: Liver samples collected from both NAFLD mouse models and human participants (80 cases) were used to evaluate the expression of TM6SF2 by using western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RNA-seq data retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were used to confirm the over-expression of TM6SF2. Knockdown and overexpression of TM6SF2 were performed to clarify the mechanistic basis of hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD. MK-4074 administration was used as a therapeutic intervention to evaluate its effect on NAFLD caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. RESULTS: Hepatic TM6SF2 levels were elevated in patients with NAFLD and NAFLD mouse models. TM6SF2 overexpression can reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, suggesting a protective role for TM6SF2 in a high-fat diet (HFD). Downregulation of TM6SF2, simulating the TM6SF2 E167K mutation condition, increases intracellular lipid deposition due to dysregulated fatty acid metabolism and is characterized by enhanced fatty acid uptake and synthesis, accompanied by impaired fatty acid oxidation. Owing to the potential effect of TM6SF2 deficiency on lipid metabolism, the application of an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor (MK-4074) could reverse the NAFLD phenotypes caused by TM6SF2 deficiency. CONCLUSION: TM6SF2 plays a protective role in the HFD condition; its deficiency enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation through dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, and MK-4074 treatment could alleviate the NAFLD phenotypes caused by TM6SF2 deficiency.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35978872/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3748/wjg.v28.i25.2937", "pt": "Journal Article", "pl": "United States"}, {"uid": 36602456, "aid": "10.1111/apha.13918", "titl": "Heme oxygenase-1 prevents non-alcoholic steatohepatitis through modulating mitochondrial quality control.", "mesh": "Animals;;; Mice;;; Disease Models, Animal;;; *Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/metabolism;;; Liver/metabolism;;; Mice, Inbred C57BL;;; *Mitochondria/metabolism;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/genetics/metabolism/pathology", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Li, Dongdong; Yuan, Xiwei; Dong, Shiming; Al-Dhamin, Zaid; Du, Jinghua; Fu, Na; Nan, Yuemin", "jour": "Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)", "affl": "Department of Traditional and Western Medical Hepatology, Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Hebei Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Fibrosis in Chronic Liver Diseases, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Department of Traditional and Western Medical Hepatology, Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Hebei Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Fibrosis in Chronic Liver Diseases, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Department of Traditional and Western Medical Hepatology, Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Hebei Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Fibrosis in Chronic Liver Diseases, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Department of Traditional and Western Medical Hepatology, Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Hebei Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Fibrosis in Chronic Liver Diseases, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Department of Traditional and Western Medical Hepatology, Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Hebei Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Fibrosis in Chronic Liver Diseases, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Department of Traditional and Western Medical Hepatology, Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Hebei Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Fibrosis in Chronic Liver Diseases, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Department of Traditional and Western Medical Hepatology, Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.;;; Hebei Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Fibrosis in Chronic Liver Diseases, Shijiazhuang, China.", "pdat": "2023 Mar", "tiab": "AIM: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and lacks effective treatment options. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a critical defense against oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver injury. This study aims to investigate the protective role and underlying mechanisms of HO-1 in NASH pathogenesis. METHODS: The hepatocyte-specific HO-1 knockout (HO-1(HEPKO) ) mice on a C57BL/6J background (HO-1(fl/fl) /Alb-Cre) were generated and fed a high-fat/western-style diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCD). Changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure were observed by transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. A mitochondrial PCR array was used to identify the crucial genes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. RESULTS: Hepatocyte-specific HO-1(HEPKO) mice developed steatohepatitis with severe steatosis, ballooning, and necroinflammation. Dysregulated hepatic expression of mitochondria-related proteins, including DRP1, Tomm20, MFN1 and MFN2 were detected in NASH animals. Ultrastructural mitochondrial damage was observed in HO-1(HEPKO) mice. Mitochondrial dysfunction was recapitulated in HO-1-knockdown cells in vitro, as evidenced by decreased membrane potential, reduced ATP content, and mtDNA damage. Conversely, HO-1 overexpression restored these changes in vitro. Mechanistically, HO-1 deficiency reduced the inhibitory effect on Tomm20, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, and thereby causing steatohepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: HO-1 attenuates diet-induced steatohepatitis by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating that HO-1 may constitute a potential therapeutic target for NASH.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36602456/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.1111/apha.13918", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 36984470, "aid": "medicina59030469 medicina-59-00469 10.3390/medicina59030469", "titl": "Evaluation of Artificial Intelligence-Calculated Hepatorenal Index for Diagnosing Mild and Moderate Hepatic Steatosis in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.", "mesh": "Humans;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging;;; Artificial Intelligence;;; Liver/pathology;;; Ultrasonography/methods;;; ROC Curve;;; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Zsombor, Zita; Ronaszeki, Aladar D; Csongrady, Barbara; Stollmayer, Robert; Budai, Bettina K; Folhoffer, Aniko; Kalina, Ildiko; Gyori, Gabriella; Berczi, Viktor; Maurovich-Horvat, Pal; Hagymasi, Krisztina; Kaposi, Pal Novak", "jour": "Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)", "affl": "Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Department of Surgery, Transplantation and Gastroenterology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Ulloi ut 78., 1082 Budapest, Hungary.;;; Medical Imaging Center, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Koranyi S. u. 2/A., 1083 Budapest, Hungary.", "pdat": "2023 Feb 27", "tiab": "Background and Objectives: This study aims to evaluate artificial intelligence-calculated hepatorenal index (AI-HRI) as a diagnostic method for hepatic steatosis. Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled 102 patients with clinically suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). All patients had a quantitative ultrasound (QUS), including AI-HRI, ultrasound attenuation coefficient (AC,) and ultrasound backscatter-distribution coefficient (SC) measurements. The ultrasonographic fatty liver indicator (US-FLI) score was also calculated. The magnetic resonance imaging fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) was the reference to classify patients into four grades of steatosis: none < 5%, mild 5-10%, moderate 10-20%, and severe >/= 20%. We compared AI-HRI between steatosis grades and calculated Spearman's correlation (r(s)) between the methods. We determined the agreement between AI-HRI by two examiners using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 68 cases. We performed a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to estimate the area under the curve (AUC) for AI-HRI. Results: The mean AI-HRI was 2.27 (standard deviation, +/-0.96) in the patient cohort. The AI-HRI was significantly different between groups without (1.480 +/- 0.607, p < 0.003) and with mild steatosis (2.155 +/- 0.776), as well as between mild and moderate steatosis (2.777 +/- 0.923, p < 0.018). AI-HRI showed moderate correlation with AC (r(s) = 0.597), SC (r(s) = 0.473), US-FLI (r(s) = 0.5), and MRI-PDFF (r(s) = 0.528). The agreement in AI-HRI was good between the two examiners (ICC = 0.635, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.411-0.774, p < 0.001). The AI-HRI could detect mild steatosis (AUC = 0.758, 95% CI = 0.621-0.894) with fair and moderate/severe steatosis (AUC = 0.803, 95% CI = 0.721-0.885) with good accuracy.

METHODS: We performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to test for the causal association between NAFLD and PCOS using data from a large-scale biopsy-confirmed NAFLD genome-wide association study (GWAS) (1483 cases and 17,781 controls) and PCOS GWAS (10,074 cases and 103,164 controls) in European ancestries. Data from glycemic-related traits GWAS (in up to 200,622 individuals) and sex hormones GWAS (in 189,473 women) in the UK Biobank (UKB) were used in the MR mediation analysis to assess potential mediating roles of these molecules in the causal pathway between NAFLD and PCOS. Replication analysis was conducted using two independent datasets from NAFLD and PCOS GWASs in the UKB and a meta-analysis of data from FinnGen and the Estonian Biobank, respectively. A linkage disequilibrium score regression was conducted to assess genetic correlations between NAFLD, PCOS, glycemic-related traits, and sex hormones using full summary statistics. RESULTS: Individuals with higher genetic liability to NAFLD were more likely to develop PCOS (OR per one-unit log odds increase in NAFLD: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.18; P = 0.013). Indirect causal effects of NAFLD on PCOS via fasting insulin only (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03; P = 0.004) and further a suggestive indirect causal effect via fasting insulin in concert with androgen levels were revealed in MR mediation analyses.

METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science for studies comparing MAFLD to NAFLD. Based on MAFLD and NAFLD status, the following subgroups were investigated for liver health: overlap fatty liver disease (FLD), NAFLD-only and MAFLD-only. Data were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: We included 17 studies comprising 9 808 677 individuals. In the general population, MAFLD was present in 33.0% (95% CI 29.7%-36.5%) and NAFLD in 29.1% (95% CI 27.1%-31.1%). Among those with FLD, 4.0% (95% CI 2.4%-6.4%) did not meet the MAFLD criteria but had NAFLD (NAFLD-only) and 15.1% (95% CI 11.5%-19.5%) was exclusively captured by the novel MAFLD definition (MAFLD-only).

In this study, we use Ch25h knockout mice, hepatic cells and liver biopsies to explore the role of Ch25h and 25-HC in lipid metabolism and accumulation in liver, determine the molecular mechanism of lipid accumulation and inflammation influenced by Ch25h and 25-HC, and assess the regulatory effects of Ch25h and 25-HC on human NAFLD. Our results indicate that mice lacking Ch25h have normal cholesterol homeostasis with normal diet, but under the condition of high fat diet (HFD), the mice show higher total cholesterol and triglyceride in serum, and prone to hepatic steatosis. Ch25h deficiency reduces the cholesterol efflux regulated by liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), increases the synthesis of cholesterol mediated by sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), and increases the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, therefore promotes hepatic steatosis.

Diagnosis of new NAFLD case was based on abdominal ultrasonography. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine whether shift work has effect on occurrence of NAFLD. RESULTS: The incidence of NAFLD was 30.43% in total subjects. After adjustment for possible confounders, the RRs of NAFLD were 1.069 (95% CI 0.998-1.146) and 1.179 (95% CI 1.059-1.312) in occasionally shift work group and frequently shift work group respectively, compared to the seldom shift work group. In stratified analyses, the RRs of NAFLD incidence linked to shift work exposure seems increase among female and elder. The results of three sensitivity analyses were similar with main analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This research provided further evidence of positive harmful effect of shift work on NAFLD incidence in Chinese rail workers, particularly in frequently shift work population.

Due to well-documented flaws associated with liver biopsy, there has been a recent emphasis on prioritizing noninvasive testing over liver biopsy for the assessment of fibrosis. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review and frequentist random effects network meta-analysis was performed among randomized controlled trials reporting pharmacologic intervention in NAFLD. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in liver stiffness measurement (LSM) via elastography. Secondary endpoints included changes in noninvasive serologic tests including APRI, fibrosis-4 index, NAFLD fibrosis score, enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) and FibroTest (FibroSure in the USA). RESULTS: Forty-five randomized controlled trials enrolling 6932 patients were identified for this network meta-analysis. Across the primary endpoint, firsocostat, semaglutide, montelukast, cilofexor plus firsocostat, obeticholic acid and diacerein (change in LSM via vibration controlled transient elastography), in addition to lubiprostone and pemafibrate (change in LSM via magnetic resonance elastography) were found to be the most effective and statistically significant treatment interventions. Similarly, the following interventions were determined to be most effective as compared to placebo among secondary endpoints: saroglitazar, lubiprostone, and obeticholic acid (change in APRI); saroglitazar, semaglutide, firsocostat and cilofexor plus firsocostat (change in ELF); obeticholic acid and belapectin [change in FibroTest/FibroSure].

The prevalence of NASH among children with NAFLD is 23%, while it ranges from 13% to 65% in adults. There are similar risk factors for NAFLD among children and adults. However, in children, the diagnostic tests in the studies of NAFLD are limited to the elevation of the alanine aminotransferase level or a liver biopsy. In adults, additional diagnostic modalities, including noninvasive tests, have been used. From the spectrum of NAFLD, patients with NASH are predominantly at risk of progressive liver disease to cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.

Since no Federal and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments exist to date, recent guidelines recommend lifestyle interventions, bariatric surgery, and pharmacotherapy, i.e. glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors for its treatment.

Genetic polymorphisms such as the rs738409 C/G variant in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) have been associated with higher prevalence of and progression along the NAFLD spectrum. This qualitative study conducted in the U.S. Southwest aimed to assess Mexican-origin men's experience receiving genetic testing for PNPLA3 risk carrier status. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 Mexican-origin men whose NAFLD status and genetic predisposition were determined as part of a previous cross-sectional study. The interview guide included questions exploring participants' insights on how genetic risk status was delivered, how the information influenced their motivation for lifestyle modification to reduce NAFLD risk, and any knowledge sharing that occurred with family members after learning of their PNPLA3 risk status. Interviews were conducted and audio recorded in English (n = 6) and Spanish (n = 11) and uploaded into NVivo software for data analysis and interpretation. Guided by the Health Belief Model, a thematic analysis approach was used to identify primary themes. RESULTS: Results highlighted men's preference for receiving this type of genetic risk information through a letter sent to their homes. General comprehension of PNPLA3 risk status was deemed high and most men stated sharing their genetic predisposition to NAFLD with their immediate family members. Participants also indicated that family and awareness of this genetic risk acted as primary motivators for implementing behavior changes (e.g., diet, physical activity) toward the prevention of more severe liver conditions. DISCUSSION: Findings from this qualitative study suggest the feasibility of communicating genetic risk for NAFLD among Mexican-origin men.

This multidimensional study comprehensively investigated the potential benefits and mechanism-of-action of statins in NAFLD. METHODS: A cross-sectional investigation was performed within the Rotterdam Study (general population; n = 4.576) and the PERSONS cohort (biopsy-proven NAFLD patients; n = 569). Exclusion criteria were secondary causes for steatosis and insufficient data on alcohol, dyslipidemia or statin use. Associations of statin use with NAFLD (among entire general population), fibrosis and NASH (among NAFLD individuals and patients) were quantified. These results were pooled with available literature in meta-analysis. Last, we assessed statins' anti-lipid and anti-inflammatory effects in 3D cultured human liver organoids and THP-1 macrophages, respectively. FINDINGS: Statin use was inversely associated with NAFLD in the Rotterdam study compared to participants with untreated dyslipidemia. In the PERSONS cohort, statin use was inversely associated with NASH, but not with fibrosis. The meta-analysis included 7 studies and indicated a not significant inverse association for statin use with NAFLD (pooled-Odds Ratio: 0.69, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.46-1.01) and significant inverse associations with NASH (pooled-OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.44-0.79) and fibrosis (pooled-OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.33-0.70). In vitro, statins significantly reduced lipid droplet accumulation in human liver organoids and downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. INTERPRETATION: Pooled results demonstrated that statin use was associated with a lower prevalence of NASH and fibrosis and might prevent NAFLD. This may be partially attributed to the anti-lipid and anti-inflammatory characteristics of statins. Given their under-prescription, adequate prescription of statins may limit the disease burden of NAFLD.

RESULTS: In the TCLSIH cohort, when replacing one type of animal protein food (eggs, processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, and fish) with an equivalent serving of plant protein foods (nuts, legumes, and whole grains), the replacement of animal protein foods with whole grains showed the strongest benefit; substituting one serving per day of whole grains for an equal amount of eggs (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79, 1.00), processed meat (HR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.91), unprocessed red meat (HR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.00), poultry (HR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.92), or fish (HR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.97) was associated with a lower risk of NAFLD. In both the TCLSIH and GNHS cohorts, replacing poultry with fish, nuts, legumes, or whole grains was associated with a lower risk of NAFLD. When different numbers of protein foods were simultaneously replaced, the risk reduction of NAFLD was stronger.

It is made up of multiple cell types, including macrophages. These are either bona fide tissue-resident Kupffer cells (KC) of embryonic origin, or differentiated from circulating monocytes. KCs are the primary immune cells populating the liver under steady state. Liver macrophages interact with hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells to maintain homeostasis, however they are also key contributors to disease progression. Generally tolerogenic, they physiologically phagocytose foreign particles and debris from portal circulation and participate in red blood cell clearance. However as immune cells, they retain the capacity to raise an alarm to recruit other immune cells. Their aberrant function leads to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD refers to a spectrum of conditions ranging from benign steatosis of the liver to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. In NAFLD, the multiple hit hypothesis proposes that simultaneous influences from the gut and adipose tissue (AT) generate hepatic fat deposition and that inflammation plays a key role in disease progression. KCs initiate the inflammatory response as resident immune effectors, they signal to neighbouring cells and recruit monocytes that differentiated into recruited macrophages in situ. Recruited macrophages are central to amplifying the inflammatory response and causing progression of NAFLD to its fibro-inflammatory stages. Given their phagocytic capacity and their being instrumental in maintaining tissue homeostasis, KCs and recruited macrophages are fast-becoming target cell types for therapeutic intervention. We review the literature in the field on the roles of these cells in the development and progression of NAFLD, the characteristics of patients with NAFLD, animal models used in research, as well as the emerging questions.

METHODS: In this study using the Optum de-identified Clinformatics database, Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed to determine the risk of HCC in statin initiators versus nonusers. We incorporated inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to minimize potential confounding. RESULTS: Among 272,431 adults with NAFLD diagnosis, IPTW model shows that statin initiators had 53% less risk of developing HCC compared with nonusers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.60). In the subcohort with fibrosis-4 index data available, statin initiation was associated with 56% hazard reduction of developing HCC in NAFLD after adjusting for fibrosis-4 index score (HR, 0.44; 0.30-0.65). The association between statin initiation and lower risk of HCC development was observed for both lipophilic statin (HR, 0.49; 0.37-0.65) and hydrophilic statin (HR, 0.40; 0.21-0.76). Moreover, we observed greater hazards reduction as the dose and duration of statin use increased. NAFLD patients with more than 600 cumulative defined daily doses of statin had 70% reduction in hazards of developing HCC (HR, 0.30; 0.20-0.43).

Recently, we demonstrated that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), but not vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), resulted in improvements to white adipose physiology and enhanced brown adipose functioning. Since beneficial alterations to liver health are also expected after bariatric surgery, comparing the post-operative effects of RYGB and VSG on liver physiology is essential to their application in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of RYGB and VSG on liver physiology were compared using diet induced mouse model of obesity. High-fat diet (HFD) was administered for 12 weeks after surgery and alterations to liver physiology were assessed. RESULTS: Both RYGB and VSG showed decreased liver weight as well as reductions to hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels. There were demonstrable improvements to NAFLD activity score (NAS) and fibrosis stage scoring after both surgeries. In RYGB, these beneficial changes to liver function resulted from the downregulation of pro-fibrotic and upregulation anti-fibrotic genes, as well as increased fatty acid oxidation and bile acid flux. For VSG, though similar alterations were observed, they were less potent.

However, the mechanism of action of CS on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has seen rare scrutiny. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of CS on lipid metabolism in NAFLD. METHODS: Components of CS ethanol extract (CSEE) were analyzed and identified using UPLC-Q-Orbirap HRMS. The candidate compounds of CS and its relative targets were extracted from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology, Swiss-Target-Prediction, and TargetNet web server. The Therapeutic Target Database, Genecards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and DisGeNET were searched for NAFLD targets. Binding affinity between potential core components and key targets was established employing molecular docking simulations. After that, free fatty acid (FFA)-induced HepG2 cells were used to further validate part of the network pharmacology results. RESULTS: Six genes, including Caspase 3 (CASP3), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein (APP) were identified as key targets. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was found to associate closely with CS's effect on NAFLD. Per molecular docking findings, toralactone and quinizarin formed the most stable combinations with hub genes. About 0.1 (vs. FFA, P<0.01) and 0.2 (vs. FFA, P<0.05) mg/ml CSEE decreased lipid accumulation in vitro by reversing the up-regulation of CASP3, EGFR, and APP and the down-regulation of PIK3CA. CONCLUSION: CSEE can significantly reduce intracellular lipid accumulation by modulating the MAPK signaling pathway to decrease CASP3 and EGFR expression.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36645186/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/232453 https://sci-hub.do/BSR20221375 https://sci-hub.do/10.1042/BSR20221375", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "England"}, {"uid": 36615764, "aid": "nu15010106 nutrients-15-00106 10.3390/nu15010106", "titl": "The Synergistic Protective Effect of gamma-Oryzanol (OZ) and N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) against Experimentally Induced NAFLD in Rats Entails Hypoglycemic, Antioxidant, and PPARalpha Stimulatory Effects.", "mesh": "Rats;;; Male;;; Animals;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control;;; Antioxidants/metabolism;;; Acetylcysteine/metabolism;;; PPAR alpha/genetics/metabolism;;; Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology;;; Liver/metabolism;;; Diet, High-Fat/adverse effects;;; Glucose/metabolism", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Alwadani, Ashwag H; Almasri, Soheir A; Aloud, Amal A; Albadr, Nawal A; Alshammari, Ghedeir M; Yahya, Mohammed Abdo", "jour": "Nutrients", "affl": "Department of of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of Home Economics, University College in Farasan, Jazan University, Jazan 54943, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.;;; Department of of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.", "pdat": "2022 Dec 26", "tiab": "This study estimated that the combined effect of gamma-Oryzanol and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats also estimated some of their mechanisms of action.

NAC was administered orally at a final concentration of 200 mg/kg, whereas gamma-Oryzanol was added to diets at a concentration of 0.16. All treatments were conducted for 17 weeks and daily. Both NAC and gamma-Oryzanol were able to reduce final body weights, fat weights, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, serum, and serum levels of liver function enzymes as well as the inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukine-6 (IL-6), and leptin in HFD-fed rats. They also improved hepatic structure and glucose tolerance, increased adiponectin levels, and reduced serum and hepatic levels of triglycerides (TGs) and cholesterol (CHOL) in these rats. These effects were concomitant with a reduction in the hepatic levels of lipid peroxides (MDA) and serum levels of LDL-C, but also with an increment in the hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). Interestingly, only treatment with gamma-Oryzanol stimulated the mRNA levels of proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) in the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) of rats. Of note, the combination therapy of both drugs resulted in maximum effects and restored almost normal liver structure and basal levels of all the above-mentioned metabolic parameters.

The second group was subclassified into normal liver (NL, n = 11), simple steatosis (SS, n= 29), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, n = 32). mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR and protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting. Our results showed that NASH patients presented higher ATG7 mRNA and ATG7 protein levels. ATG7 mRNA expression was increased in NASH compared with SS, while ATG7 protein abundance was enhanced in NASH compared with NL. ATG7 mRNA correlated negatively with the expression of some hepatic lipid metabolism-related genes and positively with endocannabinoid receptors, adiponectin hepatic expression, and omentin levels.

This phenotype was associated with the normalization of the methionine cycle and the restoration of L-carnitine and AMPK activity. Furthermore, maternal HF diet induced epigenetic regulation of important genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation via DNA methylation modifications, which were recovered by maternal one-carbon supplementation.

Recent studies have shown that both visceral adipose tissue (VAT) quantity and density (as an indirect measure of quality) are associated with metabolic profiles. Therefore, we investigated the association between VAT quantity and quality, and the prevalence and incidence of NAFLD. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this cross-sectional, retrospective cohort study, the prevalence and incidence of NAFLD were analyzed in 627 and 360 middle-aged subjects, respectively. VAT was evaluated using an unenhanced computed tomography scan, while NAFLD was evaluated using ultrasonography. The VAT area was normalized to the square value of the subjects' height in meters, the visceral fat area (VFA) index. The VAT density was described as the visceral fat density (VFD). The VFA index and VFD had an interaction effect on the prevalence of NAFLD (P = 0.0059). The VFA index (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.07; P = 0.0145, per 1.0 cm(2)/m(2)) and the VFD (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96; P = 0.0026, per 1.0 Hounsfield unit [HU]) were independently associated with the prevalence of NAFLD. In our cohort, 36 subjects developed NAFLD. The VFD (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.91; P < 0.0001, per 1.0 HU) was independently associated with the incidence of NAFLD, whereas the VFA index was not.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting liver-related outcomes following Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and non-FDA-approved EBMTs were included. Liver parameters, metabolic parameters, and weight loss were evaluated. Risk of bias was assessed using the \"risk of bias\" tool in the Cochrane Collaboration for RCTs and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria for observational studies. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies with 1710 individuals were included. Regarding the effects of EBMTs on liver fibrosis, a significant decline of NAFLD Fibrosis Score, but not transient elastography-detected liver stiffness or Fibrosis-4 Index, was observed. EBMTs significantly improved liver steatosis (control attenuation parameter and Hepatic Steatosis Index), NAFLD Activity Score, and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance. EBMTs reduced serum levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase considerably. Moreover, EBMTs had reducing effects on the serum levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol as well as body weight.

These innate immune responses contribute to the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, the role of IkappaBzeta in the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains elusive. We investigated whether IkappaBzeta was involved in the progression of NAFLD in mice. We generated hepatocyte-specific IkappaBzeta-deficient mice (Alb-Cre; Nfkbiz(fl/fl)) by crossing Nfkbiz(fl/fl) mice with Alb-Cre transgenic mice. NAFLD was induced by feeding the mice a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD). CDAHFD-induced IkappaBzeta expression in the liver was observed in Nfkbiz(fl/fl) mice, but not in Alb-Cre; Nfkbiz(fl/fl) mice. Contrary to our initial expectation, IkappaBzeta deletion in hepatocytes accelerated the progression of NAFLD after CDAHFD treatment. Although the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis-related proteins by CDAHFD remained unchanged between Nfkbiz(fl/fl) and Alb-Cre; Nfkbiz(fl/fl) mice, early-stage steatosis of the liver was significantly augmented in Alb-Cre; Nfkbiz(fl/fl) mice. Overexpression of IkappaBzeta in hepatocytes via the adeno-associated virus vector attenuated liver steatosis caused by the CDAHFD in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. This preventive effect of IkappaBzeta overexpression on steatosis was not observed without transcriptional activity. Microarray analysis revealed a correlation between IkappaBzeta expression and the changes of factors related to triglyceride biosynthesis and lipoprotein uptake.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of fibrosis-4 (FIB4) and vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), compared to liver biopsy, for the prediction of liver-related events (LREs) in NAFLD. METHODS: A total of 1,057 patients with NAFLD and baseline FIB4 and VCTE were included in a multicenter cohort. Of these patients, 594 also had a baseline liver biopsy. The main study outcome during follow-up was occurrence of LREs, a composite endpoint combining cirrhosis complications and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Discriminative ability was evaluated using Harrell's C-index. RESULTS: FIB4 and VCTE showed good accuracy for the prediction of LREs, with Harrell's C-indexes >0.80 (0.817 [0.768-0.866] vs. 0.878 [0.835-0.921], respectively, p = 0.059). In the biopsy subgroup, Harrell's C-indexes of histological fibrosis staging and VCTE were not significantly different (0.932 [0.910-0.955] vs. 0.881 [0.832-0.931], respectively, p = 0.164), while both significantly outperformed FIB4 for the prediction of LREs. FIB4 and VCTE were independent predictors of LREs in the whole study cohort. The stepwise FIB4-VCTE algorithm accurately stratified the risk of LREs: compared to patients with \"FIB4 <1.30\", those with \"FIB4 >/=1.30 then VCTE <8.0 kPa\" had similar risk of LREs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.3; 95% CI 0.3-6.8), whereas the risk of LREs significantly increased in patients with \"FIB4 >/=1.30 then VCTE 8.0-12.0 kPa\" (aHR 3.8; 95% CI 1.3-10.9), and even more for those with \"FIB4 >/=1.30 then VCTE >12.0 kPa\" (aHR 12.4; 95% CI 5.1-30.2). CONCLUSION: VCTE and FIB4 accurately stratify patients with NAFLD based on their risk of LREs. These non-invasive tests are alternatives to liver biopsy for the identification of patients in need of specialized management. LAY SUMMARY: The amount of fibrosis in the liver is closely associated with the risk of liver-related complications in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Liver biopsy currently remains the reference standard for the evaluation of fibrosis, but its application is limited by its invasiveness. Therefore, we evaluated the ability of non-invasive liver fibrosis tests to predict liver-related complications in NAFLD. Our results show that the blood test FIB4 and transient elastography stratify the risk of liver-related complications in NAFLD, and that transient elastography has similar prognostic accuracy as liver biopsy. These results support the use of non-invasive liver fibrosis tests instead of liver biopsy for the management of patients with NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35063601/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/S0168-8278(22)00002-2 https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/j.jhep.2021.12.031", "pt": "Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Netherlands"}, {"uid": 35880713, "aid": "10.1111/apt.17158", "titl": "Review article: the epidemiologic burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease across the world.", "mesh": "*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/epidemiology;;; Female;;; Humans;;; Incidence;;; Male;;; *Metabolic Syndrome/complications/epidemiology;;; *Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/epidemiology/etiology;;; Obesity/epidemiology;;; Prevalence", "majr": "", "subh": "", "auth": "Henry, Linda; Paik, James; Younossi, Zobair M", "jour": "Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics", "affl": "Center for Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Inova Fairfax Medical Campus, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.;;; Betty and Guy Beatty Center for Integrated Research, Inova Health System, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.;;; Center for Outcomes Research in Liver Diseases, Washington, DC, USA.", "pdat": "2022 Sep", "tiab": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in parallel with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Prevalence in Asia, Latin America and Middle East-North Africa (MENA) was 30.8%, 34.5% and 42.6%, respectively. Prevalence increased with age. Although prevalence was higher in men, prevalence in post-menopausal women was similar. NAFLD prevalence was higher in certain subpopulations, especially among the obese and those with metabolic syndrome (MS). However, the prevalence of lean NAFLD was 11.2%. The global prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is estimated between 2% and 6% in the general population. Approximately 7% of patients with NAFLD have advanced fibrosis; rates were between 21% and 50% among patients with NASH. Overall mortality related to NAFLD was 15-20 per 1000 person-years, and increased substantially in patients with NASH, especially in those with components of MS. Recent data suggest mortality/morbidity from NAFLD is increasing globally but NAFLD awareness remains low among patients and healthcare providers.

NAFLD liver deaths were calculated (per 100,000) as age-standardized rates (ASRs) from 195 countries and territories (21 GBD regions; 7 GBD superregions). Dietary risks included low intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts/seeds, milk, fiber, calcium, seafood omega-3 fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and high intake of red meat, processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fatty acids, and sodium. Metabolic risks included high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure (BP), fasting glucose (FG), body mass index (BMI), as well as low bone mineral density and impaired kidney function (IKF). Socio-demographic index (SDI)-adjusted partial Spearman correlation coefficients and multivariable generalized linear regression models/bidirectional stepwise selection (significance level for entry, 0.2; for stay, 0.05) determined the associations. The ASR for NAFLD liver deaths was 2.3 per 100,000 (2017) and correlated with dietary risk factors (0.131, -0.010-0.267) and metabolic risk factors (SDI-adjusted = 0.225, 95% CI 0.086-0.354). High intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and red meat (0.358, 0.229-0.475; 0.162, 0.022-0.296), and low intake of nuts/seed and milk (0.154, 0.014-0.289; 0.145, 0.004-0.280) was significant for NAFLD liver deaths. Other risk factors for liver death included IKF (0.402, 0.276-0.514), increased BMI (0.353, 0.223-0.407), FG (0.248, 0.111-0.376), and BP (0.163, 0.022-0.297). High intake of trans fatty acids (2.84% increase [1.65%-4.03%]) was the largest associated risk of NAFLD liver deaths. In addition to metabolic risks, dietary risks independently drive the global burden of NAFLD-related liver mortality.

METHODS: From April 2018 to April 2019, we extracted the electronic medical records of 481 patients with T2D who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University. Ultrasound was used to estimate NAFLD at admission. Logistic regression analysis were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The additive interaction was carried out to estimate interactions between LSFAs and insulin resistance (IR) in NAFLD patients with T2D. RESULTS: Myristic acid (14:0) and palmitic acid (16:0) were positively associated with the risk of NAFLD (OR for myristic acid (14:0): 7.516, 3.557-15.882 and OR for palmitic acid (16:0): 4.071, 1.987-8.343, respectively). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, these associations were slightly attenuated but still highly significant. Co-presence of myristic acid (14:0)>72.83 mumol/L and IR>4.89 greatly increased OR of NAFLD to 9.691 (4.113-22.833). Similarly, co-presence of palmitic acid (16:0)>3745.43mumol/L and IR>4.89 greatly increased OR of NAFLD to 6.518(2.860-14.854). However, stearic acid (18:0) and risk of NAFLD have no association. Moreover, there was no association between very-long-chain SFAs (VLSFAs) and risk of NAFLD. DISCUSSION: Myristic acid (14:0) and palmitic acid (16:0) were positively associated with the risk of NAFLD in T2D patients in China. High IR amplified the effect of high myristic acid (14:0) and high palmitic acid (16:0) on NAFLD.", "ptyp": "", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36568120/", "urlaid": "https://sci-hub.do/10.3389/fendo.2022.1051807", "pt": "Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "pl": "Switzerland"}], "message": "no one task in progress"}
